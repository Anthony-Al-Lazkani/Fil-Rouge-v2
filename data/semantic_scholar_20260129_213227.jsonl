Similarity-based retrievers provide coverage but remain shallow, whereas traversal-based methods rely on selecting seed nodes to start exploration, which can fail when queries span multiple entities and relations. We introduce ARK: Adaptive Retriever of Knowledge, an agentic KG retriever that gives a language model control over this breadth-depth tradeoff using a two-operation toolset: global lexical search over node descriptors and one-hop neighborhood exploration that composes into multi-hop traversal. ARK alternates between breadth-oriented discovery and depth-oriented expansion without depending on a fragile seed selection, a pre-set hop depth, or requiring retrieval training. ARK adapts tool use to queries, using global search for language-heavy queries and neighborhood exploration for relation-heavy queries. On STaRK, ARK reaches 59.1% average Hit@1 and 67.4 average MRR, improving average Hit@1 by up to 31.4% and average MRR by up to 28.0% over retrieval-based and agentic training-free methods. Finally, we distill ARK's tool-use trajectories from a large teacher into an 8B model via label-free imitation, improving Hit@1 by +7.0, +26.6, and +13.5 absolute points over the base 8B model on AMAZON, MAG, and PRIME datasets, respectively, while retaining up to 98.5% of the teacher's Hit@1 rate."}, "authors": [{"id": "2398901674", "name": "Joaqu'in Polonuer"}, {"id": "2382921451", "name": "Lucas Vittor"}, {"id": "2309173635", "name": "Inaki Arango"}, {"id": "2309175499", "name": "Ayush Noori"}, {"id": "2384122039", "name": "David A.

While many studies examine AI in consumer marketing, less attention addresses AI's role in creating and selecting trademarks that are distinctive, recognizable, and meaningful to consumers. Traditional economic approaches to trademarks focus almost exclusively on consumer-based, demand-side considerations regarding search. However, these approaches are incomplete because they fail to account for substantial costs faced not just by consumers, but by trademark applicants as well. Given AI's rapidly increasing role in trademark search and similarity analysis, lawyers and scholars should understand its dramatic implications. This paper proposes that AI should interest anyone studying trademarks and their role in economic decision-making. We examine how machine learning techniques will transform the application and interpretation of foundational trademark doctrines, producing significant implications for the trademark ecosystem. We run empirical experiments regarding trademark search to assess the efficacy of various trademark search engines, many of which employ machine learning methods. Through comparative analysis, we evaluate how these AI-powered tools function in practice. In an age where artificial intelligence increasingly governs trademark selection, the classic division between consumers and trademark owners deserves an updated, supply-side framework. This insight has transformative potential for encouraging both innovation and efficiency in trademark law and practice."}, "authors": [{"id": "49840486", "name": "Sonia K.

This paper integrates artificial intelligence and a physics-based model to introduce an efficient long-term scheduling framework aimed at maximizing hydropower generation during extreme heat events. The water values derived from the proposed long-term scheduling model can be used in developing effective strategies for short-term hydropower scheduling. A physics-based evaporation model (PEM), which captures key land-atmosphere interactions, is developed to account for significant variations in reservoir evaporation rates during extreme heat events. A multivariate long short-term memory (M-LSTM) forecasting model is also utilized to predict the key input parameters required for both the PEM and the long-term scheduling problem. A regression-based machine learning algorithm is also utilized to estimate the hydropower production function, which enables linear integration of the nonlinear and nonconvex behavior of hydropower plant in the mixed-integer linear formulation of the scheduling problem. The proposed model is applied to a case study of eleven cascaded hydropower units located on the Columbia river. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed long-term scheduling model effectively manages reservoir operations, mitigating the adverse impacts of extreme heat events on hydropower generation and operator profitability."}, "authors": [{"id": "2290087949", "name": "Maryam Baghkarvasef"}, {"id": "2277609793", "name": "M.

This meta-analysis synthesizes empirical evidence on the effectiveness of AI-based interventions in enhancing the learning outcomes of preservice teachers across cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains. A systematic review of 5,880 studies led to the inclusion of 19 effect sizes from 11 rigorously selected studies spanning diverse geographic and disciplinary contexts. Using Hedges’ g and a random-effects model to account for high heterogeneity, the analysis reveals a large overall effect size, affirming AI’s substantial positive impact on teacher preparation. Moderator analyses highlight the influence of contextual factors such as country, learning outcome, and intervention duration. Studies from Palestine, Ethiopia, and the UAE, revealed strong effects which suggest the importance of local readiness and institutional support. Cognitive outcomes showed the most consistent gains, while affective and psychomotor results were more variable. Most interventions operated at the Augmentation level of the SAMR model, a framework that categorizes levels of technology integration in education, indicating that transformative uses of AI in teacher education remain limited. This study offers critical insights for policymakers, educators, and global teacher education programs aiming to integrate AI effectively.

One such critical decision that nations must make is whether to use armed force. There is often only a small group of political and military leaders involved in this decision-making process. Top military commanders typically play an important role in these deliberations around whether to use force. These commanders are relied upon for their expertise. They provide information and guidance about the military options available and the potential outcomes of those actions. This article asks two questions: (1) how do military commanders make these judgements? and (2) how might AI be used to assist them in their critical decision-making processes? To address the first, I draw on existing literature from psychology, philosophy, and military organizations themselves. To address the second, I explore how AI might augment the judgment and reasoning of commanders deliberating over the use of force. While there is already a robust body of work exploring the risks of using AI-driven decision-support systems, this article focuses on the opportunities, while keeping those risks firmly in view."}, "authors": [{"id": null, "name": "Karina Vold"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Grounded by Rogers’ diffusion of innovation theory and Davis’s technology acceptance model, a mixed-mode survey design was used to assess educators’ awareness, perceived benefits, competencies, and barriers to AI adoption. Findings revealed a significant experiential divide across all measured themes, where early-career educators (with ≤5 years of experience) reported significantly higher awareness, perceived benefits, competence, and optimism about overcoming barriers than experienced educators (with ≥ 15 years of experience). The primary barrier to adoption was a shared and uniform high level of concern regarding the pedagogical and ethical implications of AI. This contrast suggests that the central challenge is a pedagogical adoption gap between educators’ operational skills and their deeper apprehension of reconciling AI with their professional identity. This study confirms prior research on technology adoption while identifying a novel ethical barrier associated with the use of generative AI in agricultural education. The findings support the recommendation of differentiated approaches to enhance the confidence of experienced educators and reinforce the ethical best practices for early-career educators."}, "authors": [{"id": "2238330290", "name": "James R.

By leveraging AI to infer site-specific wireless channel states, the proposed paradigm enables accurate prediction of channel characteristics at both link and area levels, capturing spatio-temporal evolution of radio propagation. Some novel strategies to realize the paradigm are introduced and discussed, including AI-native and AI-hybrid inference approaches. This paper also investigates how to enhance model generalization through transfer learning and improve interpretability via explainable AI techniques. Our approach demonstrates significant practical efficacy, achieving an average path loss prediction root mean square error (RMSE) of $\\sim$ 4 dB and reducing training time by 60\\%-75\\%.

Following PRISMA guidelines, we extracted and coded each paper's GenAI tool, subject area, methodology, participant profile, sample size, and the reported benefits and barriers. The majority of articles focused on GenAI‐assisted science education, followed by technology education, while research on engineering, mathematics and integrated STEM learning remained relatively limited. Text‐based GenAI was the most commonly used tool, while image‐based, video‐based, music‐based and audio‐based GenAI were rarely featured. Most studies concentrated on higher STEM education, with limited research focusing on K‐12 STEM education. Quantitative methods were predominantly used to assess the effectiveness of GenAI. GenAI offered significant benefits in STEM education, positively influencing individual learners, teachers, and the learning and teaching process. However, GenAI also posed challenges for learners, including unreliability and inaccuracy, ethical and academic integrity concerns, dependence, reduced critical thinking skills and learning efficiency, and accessibility barriers. Teachers faced challenges like limited instructional support and the need to adopt more student‐centred approaches.

This makes it difficult not only to gain valuable insights into the data and the underlying QoE influence factors, but also to build trust in the predictions of the QoE model. To address these challenges and enhance performance, we identify four critical aspects for any data-driven QoE model: explainability, context adaptability, quantification of uncertainty, and data decentralization. In this work, we focus on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which is a promising solution to obtain explainable models allowing to address all critical aspects for data-driven QoE modeling. This tutorial introduces and explains relevant concepts from XAI and related fields. We apply these techniques to two realistic use cases, video streaming QoE modeling and Web QoE modeling, for two different modeling tasks, classification and regression, and discuss their value in the context of XAI-based data-driven QoE modeling.

A central component of the success of AI‐based digital mental health interventions has to do with the level of acceptance of this new technology: the degree to which stakeholders perceive a technology as useful, user‐friendly and worth adopting. We aimed to establish the level of acceptance of AI‐based digital mental health interventions (AI chatbot, AI avatar‐based interventions) compared with the acceptance levels of teletherapy via videoconferencing among clinicians, patients and a representative community sample (i.e., potential future patients). We also explored the extent to which these differences towards these technologies might be explained by individuals' attitudes towards AI in general. Clinicians (N = 658), patients (N = 451) and US census–based community sample (N = 520) completed standardised measures of everyday artificial intelligence use, general attitudes towards AI and acceptability of digital technology use for mental health interventions. We found that community participants are most optimistic about AI‐based mental health tools (chatbots and avatars), whereas clinicians consistently express more scepticism, especially regarding usability. In our sample, general attitudes towards AI (both positive and negative) were highly associated with acceptance of chatbot and avatar‐based interventions, more than their professional role or demographic identity.

Compared to the hardware-based coil design schemes, software-based adaptive control schemes are more cost-effective since only algorithms in digital controllers are changed. However, conventional adaptive control, including the adaptive proportional-integral (PI) control, may suffer from overfitting to specific operating conditions. To this end, an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-empowered design (AI-D) approach, leveraging machine learning and meta-heuristic algorithms, is proposed in this paper to enhance the robustness of adaptive PI control against coupling variations of WPT systems. Optimal design cases tailoring for diverse dynamic performances are provided, which are validated with comprehensive scenario analysis."}, "authors": [{"id": "2362884161", "name": "Xinze Li"}, {"id": "2281423760", "name": "Zhen Sun"}, {"id": "2313354454", "name": "Xiangrong Zhang"}, {"id": "4305830", "name": "Yajie Jiang"}, {"id": "2248482777", "name": "Kezhi Mao"}, {"id": "2349602361", "name": "Yun Yang"}], "fields_of_study": null}

This is the first multisite implementation assessment of gaps between surgeon expectations and real-world effects of the Operating Room Black Box, a novel intervention that leverages artificial intelligence to improve surgical outcomes.\n\n\nObjective\nTo identify barriers and facilitators to implementing artificial intelligence-based interventions that improve intra- and postoperative care.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis qualitative study was conducted at 3 large academic centers via semistructured interviews with surgeons and implementation leaders of the AI intervention to identify areas where expectations of the technology misaligned with their experiences. Thirty surgeons and 17 implementation leaders from 3 centers that implemented the AI intervention were interviewed. Data were collected and analyzed between 2021 and 2024.\n\n\nExposure\nImplementation of the AI intervention.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nThe primary outcome was areas of misalignment between participant expectations of the AI intervention technology and actual program deliverables.\n\n\nResults\nOf 30 surgeons and 17 implementation leaders interviewed, most surgeons (17 [57%]) were between the ages of 35 and 50 years, and implementation leaders were older, typically between 51 and 80 years old (6 [35%]). Eight surgeons (27%) and 4 implementation leaders (24%) were female. Most surgeons (17 [57%]) had neutral views of the technology, 11 (37%) expressed positive views, and 2 (7%) had negative views. Interviewees identified the following 4 major themes that highlighted misalignment between user expectations and the experience of using the technology: (1) the artificial intelligence model needed considerable additional training to be usable; (2) accessing data on surgical cases was difficult and time consuming; (3) the program showed limited ability to predict postoperative complications; and (4) the program generated few academic deliverables.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nPer the results of this multisite qualitative study, successfully implementing interventions based on artificial intelligence may require deliberate efforts to minimize gaps between what surgeons expect from the interventions and what they can deliver. Our evaluation of this study's AI intervention offers lessons for addressing this critical barrier to implementation."}, "authors": [{"id": "2322947866", "name": "Melissa Thornton"}, {"id": "2373847882", "name": "Benjamin A Y Cher"}, {"id": "2394280744", "name": "Cameron Macdonald"}, {"id": "2395379913", "name": "Jocelyn G Baker"}, {"id": "2281897194", "name": "Elisa L Marten"}, {"id": "2394282529", "name": "Don Mai"}, {"id": "2404441864", "name": "Ganesh Sankaranarayanan"}, {"id": "2266350657", "name": "Courtney J.

Health AI practitioners should prioritize successful adaptation into clinical practice in order to provide meaningful benefits to patients, but translation usually requires collaboration with industry. We discuss three features of AI studies that hamper the integration of AI into clinical practice from the perspective of researchers and clinicians. These include lack of clinically relevant metrics, lack of clinical trials and longitudinal studies to validate results, and lack of patient and physician involvement in the development process. For partnerships between industry and health research to be sustainable, a balance must be established between patient and industry benefit. We propose three approaches for addressing this gap: improved transparency and explainability of AI models, fostering relationships with industry partners that have a reputation for centering patient benefit in their practices, and prioritization of overall healthcare benefits. With these priorities, we can sooner realize meaningful AI technologies used by clinicians where mutually beneficial impacts for patients, healthcare providers, and industry can be realized."}, "authors": [{"id": "2368582270", "name": "Rina Khan"}, {"id": "2403272739", "name": "Annabelle Sauve"}, {"id": "2403284323", "name": "Imaan Bayoumi"}, {"id": "2403273970", "name": "Amber L.

This systematic review explores how AI, particularly through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is transforming the way physicians and healthcare professionals respond to high-stakes clinical scenarios. The evidence gathered shows that smart algorithms are capable of detecting complex patterns in clinical, diagnostic, and laboratory data, patterns that may even elude expert clinicians, especially under the high-pressure environment of the emergency room. From acute coronary syndrome to stroke, from sepsis to respiratory failure, AI has demonstrated impressive predictive power and provides real, practical support in risk stratification, triage optimization, and faster diagnosis. Equally important is its role in automated medical image analysis, which enables quicker and more accurate diagnostic decisions, offering real-time support for clinicians. However, the widespread adoption of these technologies also brings significant challenges: the need for algorithmic transparency, the necessity of earning the trust of healthcare providers, and the sensitive ethical issues related to patient data privacy. To overcome these barriers, it is essential to involve healthcare professionals in the development and implementation of AI technologies—ensuring their clinical expertise complements the analytical power of these new tools. Targeted training programs and large-scale validation studies are critical steps for ensuring the safe and effective use of AI. Ultimately, this review confirms that AI holds great promise as a catalyst for a more efficient, timely, and patient-centered approach to emergency medicine."}, "authors": [{"id": "2358953035", "name": "N.

This article aims to explain post-adoption trajectories by developing a conceptual model of organizational barriers that shape long-term use of artificial intelligence tools in engineering work, with software development and coding assistants used as an illustrative domain. Based on a structured synthesis of recent scholarship on technology adoption, trust in artificial intelligence, cognitive load, and employee resistance to digital transformation, the study derives an integrative framework that links individual evaluations to organizational conditions. The model specifies five constructs—usefulness, trust, challenges (technical, cognitive, emotional, and process-related), organizational influence, and disengagement triggers—and articulates how their interaction shifts behavior from sustained engagement to minimal or avoided use. As a result, the article (i) proposes a barrier taxonomy relevant to engineering teams, distinguishing infrastructure and integration constraints, cognitive–emotional strain, procedural and regulatory misalignment, cultural and power dynamics, and managerial–strategic inconsistency; (ii) maps these mechanisms onto established adoption logics to show where intention-focused explanations fail to capture withdrawal dynamics; and (iii) formulates research propositions describing how organizational practices moderate the link between perceived value and real usage, and how status, identity, autonomy, and perceived fairness threats catalyze disengagement. To facilitate empirical verification, the paper outlines a planned mixed-methods design that combines large-scale secondary survey evidence on developer tool use with primary qualitative data from engineers and engineering leaders to reconstruct post-adoption pathways and identify disengagement triggers in situ. The article is intended for researchers studying technology adoption and organizational behavior, as well as for engineering managers, transformation leaders, and governance functions seeking to design workflows, policies, and incentives that support the durable, auditable, and trusted use of artificial intelligence."}, "authors": [{"id": null, "name": "Aneesha Sharma"}], "fields_of_study": null}

As AI technologies can bring about operational efficiencies and productivity gain, its environmental footprint endangers world climatic and sustainable development agendas. This paper provides a SWOT analysis of the green implementation of artificial intelligence in industrial systems under the scope of the current urgent demand on environmentally friendly AI implementation patterns. We used a mixed-method approach by analyzing the data of industrial organizations in manufacturing, energy, logistics, and technology sectors using the convenient sample of structured questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. The methodology combines Structural Equation Modeling and Partial Least Squares regression, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (based on Analytical Hierarchy Process) in order to consider the most critical success factors and the barriers to implementation. Findings indicate that organizational willingness, technological readiness, and regulatory standards all contribute positively (73.4%- variance) to the difference in the levels of green AI adoption. The SWOT analysis recognizes the high opportunities on the energy efficient algorithms, renewable computing infrastructure and integration of the circular economy whereas the barriers to change are high initial investment, skills deficiency and technology hurdles. The research has a theoretical impact in that it creates a framework of Green AI Adoption that combines the three aspects of environmental, technological and organizational and is practical due to its offering of the implementation roadmaps that can be used by industrial practitioners.

The main points of concern are related to ethics, plagiarism and the growth of dishonesty. With the help of AI, a sudden spurt of artists, authors and other literary people has sprung forth on the literary horizon. Now, anyone can become a writer, poet, artist or so, within no time. There is no need for talent and calibre. As a consequence, a large number of such fake talents in the field of art and literature are producing their AI-inspired works without making any substantial effort. Not only this, these pseudo-artists and writers are also making money. In the field of cinema, AI-generated scripts and music have become the order of the day. Another frightening aspect is the growth of vandalism. Some unscrupulous people have even tried to create caricatures and funny variants of many famous paintings by renowned painters. The disfiguration of the world-famous painting of Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci is a classic example. In short, the world of literature and arts is likely to experience a cataclysmic change in the near future if the proper checks and controls are not exercised by the lawmakers in this regard.

This prospectus synthesises current applications and outlines future research directions for integrating Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into marine ecosystem modelling while maintaining scientific rigour. I present a structured framework for integrating GenAI across eight interconnected components of the modelling cycle: model scoping, data gathering, conceptual framework development, model development, model execution, validation and calibration, reporting and stakeholder engagement. Through analysis of current applications and emerging research, I demonstrate how GenAI can automate routine tasks, democratise access to sophisticated modelling approaches, and improve model quality. Achieving success will require overcoming persistent challenges, including data limitations, institutional barriers and ethical concerns. I propose a research agenda addressing three streams: capability assessment to systematically evaluate GenAI's potential in marine ecosystem modelling; avenues for ensuring scientific integrity and reliability; and socio‐technical integration to address ethical and institutional challenges. While GenAI offers the potential to enhance modelling, a human‐centered approach is essential, where GenAI augments, rather than replaces, human expertise in model validation, interpretation of results and ensuring sustainable management outcomes. To support readers new to this space, a primer in the supporting information outlines practical considerations for accessing GenAI tools, from cloud‐based services to locally‐run models and their implications for privacy, reproducibility and computational requirements."}, "authors": [{"id": "2003694689", "name": "S.

AI technologies such as machine learning and big data analytics assist in policy planning and simulation, enabling policymakers to anticipate the social and economic consequences of decisions. AI-driven analytics can monitor public opinion, predict voter behavior, and enable micro-targeted campaigning, reshaping the dynamics of elections. Beyond domestic politics, AI models support crisis management and diplomacy by simulating scenarios to predict conflicts, assess risks, and inform negotiation strategies. Additionally, AI enhances cybersecurity and helps detect disinformation, protecting democratic processes against manipulation. However, the use of AI in politics raises significant ethical, social, and legal issues. Algorithmic decision-making may embed biases, reduce transparency, and concentrate power in the hands of those who control these systems. Concerns about data privacy, accountability, and equitable access further complicate AI’s integration into public life. Thus, while AI can make governance more efficient, responsive, and participatory, its deployment must be balanced with rigorous ethical standards, transparency measures, and regulatory oversight to preserve democratic integrity. Ultimately, AI’s rise represents a transformative shift in modern politics, offering both opportunities and challenges that society must carefully navigate."}, "authors": [{"id": "2406161205", "name": "Kamran Valizada"}], "fields_of_study": null}

With such conflicting claims and ambitions, it is unclear how the net environmental impact of AI could be quantified. The answer is prone to uncertainty for different reasons, among others: lack of transparency, interference with market expectations, lack of standardized methodology for quantifying direct and indirect impact, and the quick evolutions of models and their requirements. This report provides answers and clarifications to these different elements. Firstly, we consider the direct environmental impact of AI from a top-down approach, starting from general information and communication technologies (ICT) and then zooming in on data centers and the different phases of AI development and deployment. Secondly, a framework is introduced on how to assess both the direct and indirect impact of AI.

There were major barriers such as absence of formal training (only 15.4% had any institutional training), lack of infrastructure, and perceived risks to academic integrity and data quality. There was substantial interest in professional development, with a request from 89.1% of faculty members for the AI-related courses. The study, in turn, reveals a real difference between what AI can do and what is used at the Hanoi Metropolitan University (HNMU) for teaching purposes.

However, traditional bicycle designs exhibit notable deficiencies in functionality, personalization, and health management. While artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been extensively applied in various fields, including professional cycling competitions like the Tour de France, its potential to introduce new possibilities to MC remains uncertain. Therefore, we undertook a comprehensive investigation into the impact and application of AI on the development of MC, aiming to facilitate the digital and intelligent transformation of MC. Method: We selected representative bicycle enterprises and related projects in the application of AI, including Specialized, Trek, Giant, Garmin, and some mass-based bicycle races for research. Using the principle of comparative experiments, we collected and compared multiple data in aspects such as the evaluation of riding performance (average riding distance, average riding speed, fatigue, etc.), user satisfaction, and the participation rate in races of MC under the circumstances of traditional mode and the AI-based mode through web information queries, DeepSeek, SPSS, and Tableau. Thus, we analyzed the impact of AI on the development of MC and made an objective summary. The research shows (compared with the traditional mode): (1) AI analyzes users' body shapes, skeletal features, riding habits, etc., through deep learning algorithms to customize bicycles on a personalized basis. (User satisfaction increased by 92%, the riding comfort score rose by 40%, the average daily riding distance grew by 12%, and the fatigue after long rides decreased by 30%). (2) The AI-driven health management system can help users avoid excessive fatigue or injuries. (The average weekly riding distance increased by 25%, and the performance improved by 8%). (3) The MC events using AI algorithms have optimized the route and diversified the competition formats, attracting more participants. In previous studies, AI has brought benefits to the bicycle industry, yet there is scant research based on MC. However, this study reveals some challenges: (1) The application of AI algorithms in low-resource scenarios; (2) Issues related to user privacy protection; (3) Problems concerning the popularization of the technology. We suggest: (1) Verify the feasibility and effectiveness of AI technology in practical applications in MC through small-scale pilot experiments.

Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, including large language models (LLM), may complement expert judgment by systematically identifying trials with limited enrollment potential. The objective of this study was to compare investigator and LLM-based accrual estimates against actual accrual outcomes for gastrointestinal (GI) oncology trials. A secondary objective was to evaluate whether LLM-based accrual estimates could flag trials at risk of non-accrual.\n Methods:\n This study retrospectively examined GI oncology trials that closed before July 2024, prior to the adoption of the Triomics PRISM platform. For each trial, three measures were compared: investigator-derived accrual estimates generated before activation, actual patient accrual, and projections from OncoLLM (an LLM fine-tuned on institutional data and oncology guidelines). Accuracy was evaluated using two complementary approaches. First, the mean absolute error (MAE) was calculated between projected and actual accrual across trials. Second, a binary classification framework was applied using a pragmatic cutoff of ≤5 projected patients to flag trials at risk of non-accrual. Sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy were measured.\n Results:\n A total of 8 gastrointestinal oncology trials were included, with an average total accrual of 0.9 patients (SD 0.8). Investigator estimates were more accurate for continuous prediction (MAE 3.9 vs. 8.8 for OncoLLM). In the binary analysis, 4 of 8 trials (50%) closed with zero accrual. OncoLLM correctly classified 3 of the 4 trials as at risk of non-accrual (sensitivity 75%, specificity 100%). Across all 8 trials, OncoLLM correctly classified 7 (88%) as either at risk of non-accrual or not.\n Conclusions:\n While investigator estimates were closer to observed accrual when measured continuously, OncoLLM demonstrated value as a screening tool for identifying trials at risk of non-accrual. The model correctly classified 7 of 8 trials and flagged 3 of 4 non-accruing studies as at risk of non-accrual.

However, its integration into clinical practice raises complex ethical challenges that must be addressed to ensure responsible and equitable use. This chapter aims to explore the ethical implications of AI in surgery through the lens of the four foundational principles of medical ethics: autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. Respecting patient autonomy requires clinicians to disclose all relevant information and ensure understanding of a proposed intervention (or AI tool) for a patient to make an informed, voluntary decision. Numerous studies have shown that both patients and clinicians often lack sufficient understanding of AI tools, complicating efforts to explain their intended function, or obtain truly informed consent for their use in patient care. This has the potential to diminish trust in the patient–clinician relationship and must be considered when using AI tools. AI's potential to uphold beneficence is evident in its ability to enhance surgical precision and outcomes. Yet, its reliance on historical data introduces risks of bias and error, threatening the principle of nonmaleficence. In this chapter, we explore these topics further to highlight the need for robust oversight and clinician involvement to prevent harm to patients. When biased data are used to train an AI tool, it may lead to unequal care across patient populations—i.e., exacerbating existing disparities in health care. Additionally, the lack of clear accountability for AI-driven errors raises legal and ethical concerns about liability—whether it lies with clinicians, health care institutions, or developers. To ethically integrate AI into surgical practice, the chapter calls for comprehensive frameworks that ensure transparency, data integrity, clinician and patient education, and regulatory oversight. These measures are essential to safeguard patient welfare as AI continues to reshape the future of surgical care."}, "authors": [{"id": "2284746396", "name": "Nicole Meredyth"}, {"id": "2384422148", "name": "Paola A.

The findings indicate that most teachers believe AI cannot replace teachers but can play a supportive role in instruction. While some teachers actively use AI tools for lesson material design, concept reinforcement, and assessment processes, others have not yet integrated this technology into their practices. Although teachers generally maintain a positive attitude toward students’ use of AI tools, several concerns were raised regarding the lack of technological resources and the risk that students may become excessively dependent on readily accessible information. Some teachers emphasized that constant reliance on ready-made solutions may reduce students’ critical thinking skills and their ability to solve problems independently. Additionally, concerns were expressed that the widespread use of AI in education may negatively affect creative thinking, foster an emotionally detached generation, and raise ethical challenges. These findings highlight the need to support teachers in ensuring the conscious and effective use of AI technologies in education.

In this paper, we address this gap by identifying key challenges in developing technical frameworks for AI systems’ regulation and proposing conceptual, methodological, and practical solutions to address these challenges. In this regard, we introduce the concept of AI’s operational qualification and propose the temporal self-replacement test, akin to certification tests for human operators, to examine the AI’s operational qualification. We propose measuring AI’s operational qualification across its operational properties critical for its regulatory fitness and introduce the operational qualification score as a pragmatic measure of AI’s regulatory fitness. In addition, we design and develop a Secure Framework for AI Regulation (SFAIR), a tool for automatic, recurrent, and secure examination of an AI’s operational qualification and attestation of its regulatory fitness, leveraging the proposed test and measure. Key strengths of SFAIR include its regulatory focus, flexibility in adapting to evolving regulatory requirements, and conformity to the secure-by-design principle. To achieve this, in addition to the aforementioned, we introduce a novel threat model for AI regulation frameworks. Considering the identified threats, we leverage randomization, masking, encryption-based schemes, and real-time monitoring to secure SFAIR operations. We also leverage AMD’s Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Encrypted State (SEV-ES) for enhanced system security. We validate the efficacy of the temporal self-replacement test and the practical utility of SFAIR by demonstrating its capability to support regulatory authorities in automated, recurrent, and secure AI qualification examination and attestation of its regulatory fitness using an open-source, high-risk AI system.

However, research on how these technologies is integrated into pre-service and in-service teacher training remains fragmented, with limited synthesis across pedagogical, psychological, and institutional dimensions. This systematic review synthesizes empirical evidence (2025) on the integration of GenAI and digital simulations in teacher training programmes, examining their effects on pedagogical competencies, digital readiness, and professional identity formation. The bibliographic coupling results show that the included studies cluster into four main intellectual groups. The strongest cluster focuses on teaching and learning foundations, reflecting shared pedagogical references. A second cluster centres on teacher education and professional development, linked through TPACK, readiness, and adoption models. A third cluster connects curriculum and subject-specific research, while a fourth highlights technology-driven studies on AI, VR/AR, and digital learning environments. Together, these clusters illustrate both a common theoretical base and growing diversification in AI-related teacher education research. GenAI emerged as a pedagogical partner that enhances lesson planning, differentiation, feedback, and teacher self-directed professional development. Digital simulations, including VR, avatar-based environments, and 3D modelling, supported communication skills, design thinking, and scenario-based decision-making. Across studies, teachers displayed curiosity and optimism but lacked comprehensive AI literacy, with readiness shaped by TPACK profiles, digital-competence frameworks, TAM and TPB constructs, and evolving professional identities. Key barriers included infrastructure inequality, insufficient training, overreliance on self-report outcomes, and concerns about creativity, authenticity, and ethical use. Teacher education programmes must embed structured AI-literacy curricula, model AI-rich instruction, ensure equitable access to technological infrastructure, and strengthen institutional support systems. Policy frameworks should incorporate ethical guidelines, assessment standards, and mechanisms for sustained professional development. AI-enabled teacher training holds substantial potential to enhance pedagogical competence and reshape professional identity. Yet its effectiveness depends on long-term integration, rigorous evaluation, and equitable implementation. Coordinated curricular, institutional, and policy reforms are essential for translating AI innovation into meaningful and sustainable teacher development."}, "authors": [{"id": "2271386361", "name": "Nirumala Rothinam"}, {"id": "2363478296", "name": "Rama Vengrasalam"}, {"id": "2363478298", "name": "Samikannu Jabamoney"}, {"id": "49335960", "name": "Sivabala Naidu"}, {"id": "2255025305", "name": "R.

These failures are rarely due to technical limitations alone, but instead reflect deeper challenges related to organisational readiness, leadership, culture and behavioural change.\n \n \n \n This educational article presents a strategic transformation framework for the adoption of AI in healthcare, emphasizing that successful implementation requires simultaneous attention to both performance outcomes and organisational health.\n \n \n \n Drawing on the Beyond Performance 2.0 model, we propose a five‐frame approach—aspire, assess, architect, act and advance—to guide healthcare organisations across the full AI adoption journey.\n \n \n \n The framework begins with defining a clear and compelling aspiration for intelligent healthcare, aligned with organisational purpose and clinical priorities. It then emphasises systematic assessment of technical capabilities, governance structures, and underlying mindsets that may enable or impede change. The architect phase focuses on designing a balanced portfolio of AI initiatives alongside behavioural and cultural levers that foster understanding, role modelling, and reinforcement. Effective execution is supported through appropriate delivery models, strong governance, and continuous measurement of impact across initiatives, organisational health, performance, and enterprise value. Finally, the advance frame highlights the importance of institutionalising learning, ethical oversight and adaptive renewal to sustain long‐term transformation.\n \n \n \n By integrating strategy, leadership and culture with technological innovation, this framework offers actionable guidance for healthcare leaders seeking to move beyond isolated AI deployments towards resilient learning health systems.

A total of 31 national and international publications (2010–2025) from the Scopus, Web of Science, SciELO, and Google Scholar databases were analyzed using the PICO strategy, covering variables such as productivity, environmental sustainability, and economic feasibility. It was observed that, although few empirical studies have been carried out directly in Rondônia, evidence from other regions and tropical contexts indicates potential gains of up to 10 bags per hectare in grain production and reductions of up to 90% in pesticide use with AI-based solutions. These results, although inferential, suggest high potential for local application, especially in crops such as coffee, cocoa, and soybeans. In addition to promoting production efficiency, AI contributes to lowcarbon agricultural practices and the mitigation of environmental impacts. In economic terms, analyses indicate a return on investment within up to three harvests, depending on production scale, while small and medium-sized producers remain dependent on cooperatives and credit policies to enable access. It is concluded that AI is promising for agriculture in Rondônia, but its full adoption requires public policies, digital inclusion and the strengthening of regional research."}, "authors": [{"id": "2404233674", "name": "Leonardo Lopes Almeida"}, {"id": "2404216206", "name": "Leslen Laianny Lima Soares"}, {"id": "2300907436", "name": "Silvana Fraga da Silva"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Drawing on the work of Andy Clarno, which demonstrates how Israel’s decreasing reliance on Palestinian labour made them inessential to exploitation, this article argues that Palestinians are valuable to Israel for another purpose: experimentation. For over fifty years, Palestinians have been rendered as test subjects for the development of surveillance and warfare technologies, in what Antony Lowenstein calls “the Palestine Laboratory.” AI introduces a dual paradigm where both Palestinian lives and deaths are turned into sites of data dispossession. This duality demands keeping Palestinians alive to generate constantly updating data for the lethal algorithmic systems that target them, while their deaths generate further data to refine and market those systems as “battle-tested.” The article describes this state as an algorithmic death-world, adapted from Achille Mbembe’s conception of necropolitics.

The study aims to evaluate AI’s multifaceted role across four key domains: enhancing diagnostic accuracy, bolstering public health surveillance, optimizing resource allocation, and addressing critical ethical and equity-related challenges. Utilizing a descriptive and analytical survey design, a sample of 300 healthcare employees, selected through simple random sampling, was administered a structured questionnaire with a five-point Likert scale. The collected data was subjected to rigorous statistical analysis using a suite of tools, including Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), chi-square tests, correlation analysis, and factor analysis. The findings reveal a significant consensus among respondents that AI technologies substantially improve the efficiency and precision of medical diagnoses, with 72% of surveyed staff agreeing on its positive impact. Furthermore, the study identifies a strong positive correlation between AI adoption and the optimization of hospital resources, demonstrating its potential to alleviate the pressures of high patient volumes and limited staffing. While the benefits are clear, the research also highlights persistent and significant challenges, notably in the areas of algorithmic bias, data privacy, and the existing gaps in digital literacy among different employee groups. The conclusion posits that while AI holds immense potential to revolutionize public healthcare, its successful and sustainable integration necessitates a strategic and balanced approach that prioritizes robust governance frameworks, substantial investment in digital infrastructure, and comprehensive AI literacy and training programs for medical professionals. This holistic approach is essential to ensure that AI serves as an equitable and ethical force for progress."}, "authors": [{"id": "2378554612", "name": "Priya Yadav"}, {"id": null, "name": "Ajeet Yadav"}, {"id": null, "name": "Abhilasha Jain"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a tool to supplement these interactions by improving perioperative risk communication, tailoring patient education, and reducing physician workload. Current applications include chatbots for preconsultation history gathering, AI-generated decision aids, and risk prediction models, which synthesize large datasets to provide individualized outcome predictions. Visualization platforms and large language model-driven documents further demonstrate potential to improve readability, completeness, and patient comprehension compared with traditional surgeon-generated materials. Research suggests that AI may enhance shared decision-making by increasing patient understanding, reducing decisional conflict, and supporting individualized risk-benefit discussions. Populations with complex needs—including patients with multiple comorbidities, limited English proficiency, or low health literacy—may experience particular benefit from AI-assisted communication. Indirect advantages are also evident; studies of ambient AI scribes report decreased documentation burden, reduced after-hours work, and improved patient engagement, suggesting downstream improvements in the patient–physician relationship. Despite these promising developments, limitations persist. AI models are prone to bias and lack transparency, raising concerns regarding fairness, accuracy, and trustworthiness. Overreliance on AI risks diminishing essential human elements of care, while errors in translation or misrepresentation of nuance may disproportionately affect vulnerable groups. Ensuring robust evaluation, representative training datasets, and clinician oversight is critical to safe implementation. AI tools show substantial promise in improving surgical communication, but more research is required to establish their effectiveness, address ethical challenges, and define best practices for integration into clinical care."}, "authors": [{"id": "2403476074", "name": "Elizabeth A.

These developments signal a shift toward more comprehensive, context-aware analytic systems capable of supporting complex clinical workflows in spine care. Despite these gains, widespread clinical adoption remains limited. High internal performance metrics do not consistently translate into reliable generalizability, interpretability, or real-world clinical readiness.

This paper examines how generative AI systems challenge traditional human-centered models of artistic creation that have long shaped art theory and aesthetics. Drawing on interdisciplinary perspectives from art history, philosophy of art, and digital humanities, the study explores the shifting boundaries between human agency and machine participation in the creative process. It argues that artificial intelligence should not be understood merely as a technical instrument but as a co-creative agent that reconfigures established notions of originality, intentionality, and artistic labor.\nThrough a critical analysis of selected AI-generated artworks, digital exhibitions, and contemporary theoretical debates, the paper investigates how meaning and value are negotiated in works produced through human–machine collaboration. Particular attention is given to emerging questions of authorship, intellectual ownership, and the evolving role of the artist in an era of algorithmic creativity. The discussion further situates AI-driven art within broader cultural and ethical frameworks, addressing concerns related to transparency, algorithmic bias, and the commodification of creativity in digital economies.\nBy proposing a revised conceptual framework for understanding creativity in the age of artificial intelligence, this study contributes to ongoing debates in contemporary aesthetics and digital art studies. The findings suggest that rather than diminishing human creativity, AI expands the creative field by enabling new aesthetic practices, critical interpretations, and modes of artistic engagement. This research offers valuable insights for scholars in the arts and humanities and provides a foundation for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the cultural implications of artificial intelligence in artistic production."}, "authors": [{"id": "2405022601", "name": "Dr. Kalpna Singh"}, {"id": "2403895105", "name": "Anjali"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Building on a mixed-methods baseline study grounded originally in the Theory of Planned Behavior, the research applies Freirean concepts – the “banking” model of education, problem-posing pedagogy, dialogic learning, and conscientization – as a new lens. The reanalysis reveals that students clustered by the original study into two profiles exhibit markedly different relationships with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Cluster 1 students, those with mature epistemological beliefs, cautious ChatGPT attitudes, minimal dishonesty, demonstrate a more critical and self-directed engagement with AI, echoing Freire’s vision of learners as co-creators of knowledge. Cluster 2 students, those with naï ve epistemological beliefs, positive ChatGPT attitudes, higher dishonesty, often treat ChatGPT as an authoritative source of answers which is a pattern akin to Freire’s banking model, with risks of dependency and surface learning. Freire’s framework highlights contradictions in the AI-assisted classroom that while generative AI can support learning, it can also reinforce passive consumption of information and undermine student autonomy if uncritically used. The discussion culminates in educational implications, arguing for a dialogical and critical pedagogical integration of AI. By conscientizing both educators and learners about AI’s opportunities and pitfalls, the Freirean approach can help transform the use of tools like ChatGPT from a shortcut that threatens academic honesty into a catalyst for empowerment, critical thinking, and co-learning in the modern classroom."}, "authors": [{"id": null, "name": "Bryan M Nozaleda"}, {"id": null, "name": "Beverly M Addun"}], "fields_of_study": null}

The emerging new paradigm called agentic AI involves agents that move beyond decision support tools to becoming semi-autonomous collaborators in research, clinical, and rehabilitation tasks.\n\n\nPURPOSE\nThe purpose of this review is to summarize how recent advances (April 2022 to October 2025) in automation, prediction, and augmentation agents are poised to transform the practice of orthopaedics; and to outline the conceptual, technical, and ethical foundations of this transition.\n\n\nRECENT FINDINGS\nAn agent is software that can process information and act independently to execute a set of defined tasks. It can seek knowledge, ask for help, deploy other software, and learn from its actions. Automation, prediction and augmentation agents can be leveraged in multi-agent and federated-learning architectures, working together to create coordinated ecosystems that can manage complex tasks and that improve with clinical use. Collectively, the output of such ecosystems is referred to as agentic AI. However, regulatory and ethical concerns underscore the need for transparency, equity, and the preservation of human agency within these frameworks.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nAgentic AI marks a transition from passive tools that merely assist clinicians to autonomous systems that act alongside them.

While AI applications demonstrate high efficacy within isolated domains, they rarely achieve the cross-domain integration necessary for realizing systemic benefits. Our prior research identified this fragmentation paradox, revealing that 91.5% of urban AI implementations operate at the lowest levels of integration. While the Urban Systems Artificial Intelligence Framework (UAIF) offers a technical blueprint for integration, realizing this vision is contingent upon organizational readiness. This paper addresses this critical gap by introducing the Urban AI Governance Maturity Model (UAIG), developed using a Design Science Research methodology. Distinguished from generic maturity models, the UAIG operationalizes Socio-Technical Systems theory by establishing a direct Governance-Technology Interlock that specifically links organizational maturity levels to the engineering requirements of cross-domain AI. The model defines five maturity levels across five critical dimensions: Strategy and Investment; Organizational Structure and Culture; Data Governance and Policy; Technical Capacity and Interoperability; and Trust, Ethics, and Security.

Based on the reviewed experience of their application in the Ministry of Finance of Russia, the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia, and the Ministry of Digital Development of Russia, it seems that the questions of using artificial intelligence in the management of program expenditures of the federal budget require a comprehensive theoretical and legal understanding. During the examination, the author conducted an analysis of the implementation of artificial intelligence technologies in the format of the Electronic Budget 2.0. As a result of the analysis, the author presents proposals for the further functioning of artificial intelligence technologies in the process of developing and executing state programs of the Russian Federation within the framework of the budget process, as well as recommendations for updating the existing regulatory legal foundations for regulating artificial intelligence in the budget process. The study applied formal legal, comparative legal, and systemic methods, as well as methods of legal modeling and analysis of law enforcement practice. The analysis utilized legal acts, program documents, and official materials from federal executive authorities, along with a generalization of departmental experience in implementing artificial intelligence technologies in the budget process. The scientific novelty of the study lies in the comprehensive theoretical and legal analysis of the use of artificial intelligence technologies in managing program expenditures of the federal budget, taking into account the specifics of the digital transformation of the budget process. For the first time, the approaches of the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation, and the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media of the Russian Federation to the implementation of artificial intelligence at various stages of managing program expenditures have been systematized and compared. It is substantiated that artificial intelligence can serve as an effective tool for reducing procedural costs in the budget process without redistributing budgetary powers and substituting the discretion of officials. The conclusion is drawn about the necessity of forming special legal regulations for the application of intelligent services in the \"Electronic Budget\" system, including establishing their status, requirements for transparency and verifiability of algorithms, as well as a clear delineation of responsibility between humans and AI."}, "authors": [{"id": "2406893904", "name": "Dmitrii Sergeevich Samorodskii"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Four decades after WarGames, lawyers are now facing similar challenges of learning to use and communicate with artificial intelligence––hopefully without destroying the world. Artificial intelligence tools, such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, are quickly being incorporated into legal practice. These systems can draft documents, perform analysis, and support other legal tasks. While lawyers adjust to these new technologies, courts and regulatory authorities are actively developing appropriate frameworks to guide and supervise the use of these tools within the sector.\nThis first installment in this series lays the foundation with a brief history of artificial intelligence, the rise of generative models, and the problem of “hallucinations” that make these tools especially dangerous for lawyers. It also surveys the first wave of cases, where courts sanctioned attorneys and pro se litigants for relying on hallucinated citations, imposed new procedural safeguards, and began confronting broader disputes over evidence, intellectual property, education, and government transparency. The next installments will shift from cases to rules by examining the American Bar Association’s Formal Opinion 512. Formal Opinion 512 is expansive, so it will be examined in two parts, first through its guidance on competence, confidentiality, and communication, and then through its treatment of candor, supervision, and fees. From there, the series ill turn to the rapidly evolving regulatory landscape, surveying federal inaction, California’s aggressive framework, the European Union’s AI Act, and Arkansas’s initial steps. The final entries in this series will focus on practice by outlining best practices that lawyers can adopt today and previewing the new skills that will define the next frontier of lawyer competence."}, "authors": [{"id": "123261159", "name": "Cliff McKinney"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Breast cancer treatments vary, with surgery being one of them. \nIn this review, we aim to evaluate artificial Intelligence’s ability to predict surgical outcomes, complications, and survival rates after breast cancer surgery by analyzing original research conducted over the last 5 years. \nMaterials and Methods: A PubMed search was conducted by two authors from January 1, 2020, to April 13, 2025, using the keywords \"Artificial Intelligence\" and \"Breast Surgery\". After elimination, 14 of the 215 articles were full-text screened, and nine original articles were selected for inclusion in our review. \nDiscussion: Artificial intelligence models and systems have had a significant impact on the medical field, and breast cancer surgery is no exception. Several original research studies have explored AI's ability to predict surgical outcomes and postoperative results. In this review, we focus on the postoperative aspects of breast cancer surgery and its application of artificial intelligence.  \nOf the nine articles included in this paper, all reported multiple statistically significant results (p <0.05). Although no prospective research directly compares artificial intelligence with practicing physicians, artificial intelligence’s ability to accurately predict surgical outcomes, complications, and survival has shown higher accuracy and c-index than commonly used prediction methods, as reported in multiple studies. \nConclusion: Artificial Intelligence can be a valuable asset in helping surgeons and medical doctors worldwide predict prognosis with improved systems and accuracy rates, even surpassing those of currently used conservative systems. There is a lack of information on PubMed regarding the comparison of these two aspects, particularly with larger sample sizes. More research should be conducted on this topic, particularly in comparing Artificial Intelligence systems and models with current systems and evaluation methods."}, "authors": [{"id": "2247753801", "name": "Abdullah Emre Akşun"}, {"id": "2405952542", "name": "İsmail Canbaş"}, {"id": "2405945123", "name": "Arda Işık"}], "fields_of_study": null}

This study aims to leverage the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technologies to establish a dynamic, precise system for sports injury prediction and prevention, thereby reducing injury rates and enhancing rehabilitation strategies. A comprehensive sports injury feature database was developed by integrating multi-source data, including physiological parameters collected from wearable devices, biomechanical data from video motion capture systems, and clinical rehabilitation records. Machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, were employed to identify and analyze key risk factors for injuries, such as peak joint load and muscle fatigue index. Model performance was further optimized through A/B testing and cross-validation. Longitudinal cohort tracking of athletes was conducted, and the effectiveness of intervention measures was validated through a real-time feedback system. The AI-driven model demonstrated a predictive accuracy of 89.7% (AUC = 0.93), representing a substantial improvement over traditional methods, which achieved only 72.4% accuracy. For chronic injuries such as ankle instability, personalized intervention protocols led to a 34% reduction in recurrence rates. The exoskeleton-assisted rehabilitation system enhanced gait correction efficiency by 41% while simultaneously reducing recovery time. Furthermore, multimodal data fusion techniques successfully identified 15 high-risk movement patterns, providing objective, data-driven insights to optimize training regimens. The integration of AI and big data technologies facilitates the early detection and precise prevention of sports injuries through dynamic monitoring and sophisticated pattern recognition. Despite these advances, challenges related to data privacy, interdisciplinary collaboration, and algorithm transparency remain. Future research should focus on expanding the diversity of sample populations and exploring the potential application of AI in sports psychology interventions.

This has led to studies focusing on students’ perspectives, but there is a lack of research on educators’ experiences with artificial intelligence in classrooms. The paper provides an overview of educators’ perceptions and experiences with AI applications through a systematic review. This review synthesises 34 studies from 435 articles published between 2021 and 2024. The reviewed studies include countries from Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa and involve both pre-service and in-service educators across primary, secondary and tertiary levels. Based on the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge framework, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and the Substitution-Augmentation-Modification-Redefinition model, this review identifies themes across pedagogical benefits, ethical concerns and implementation challenges. The findings show that most studies focused on the technical aspects of artificial intelligence rather than educators’ real experience applying it in classrooms. Hence, this paper recognises critical gaps, including the need for longitudinal studies on integration, frameworks for artificial intelligence-driven pedagogy, and professional development initiatives tailored to educators’ diverse levels of competence. This provides valuable guidelines for policymakers, institutions, and future researchers for bridging the gap between artificial intelligence and pedagogy.

Traditional teaching approaches, focused on predictability, knowledge transfer, and memorization, are increasingly inadequate in a society marked by rapid change and instant, free access to information. In this context, pedagogy rooted in metacognitive predicates, particularly promoting self-knowledge, independent learning, and the ability to learn how to learn, emerges as the most effective response to social shifts driven by AI. The paper offers guidelines for integrating metacognitive practices into classroom settings, encouraging reflective consideration of their influence on learning. Additionally, it discusses the potential for AI itself to act as a partner in cultivating metacognitive skills, fostering more reflective and autonomous educational practices. Metacognition, often seen as uniquely human, is highlighted as a crucial differentiator in the competition with AI-driven machines, especially amid ongoing labor market transformations.

This paper surveys the rapidly expanding body of literature examining the relationship between AI and entrepreneurial activity, offering a comprehensive reference for scholars in entrepreneurship and related fields. The review begins by critically examining existing definitions of AI, highlighting how conceptual ambiguity and overly broad operationalization in empirical research may obscure a clear understanding of AI’s entrepreneurial impacts. Building on this foundation, the paper synthesizes theoretical and empirical insights on the influence of AI on entrepreneurial opportunity recognition, decision-making under uncertainty, technology adoption by startups, entry barriers, and firm performance. Drawing on empirical evidence from the German Socio-Economic Panel, the study demonstrates that entrepreneurs—particularly those employing workers—exhibit significantly higher awareness and usage of AI technologies than paid employees. The analysis further explores indirect effects of AI on entrepreneurship through changes in local and sectoral labor markets. Evidence suggests that automation-oriented AI tends to increase necessity-driven entrepreneurship, whereas AI that augments or transforms jobs fosters opportunity-based entrepreneurial activity. Additionally, AI reshapes regional entrepreneurial ecosystems by reconfiguring existing elements, generating new processes, and potentially diminishing the importance of geographical proximity. Finally, the paper examines the implications of AI regulation for entrepreneurship, with particular reference to the European Union’s data protection and AI governance frameworks. The study concludes by outlining key implications for future entrepreneurship research and policy formulation.\n\nKeywords: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Entrepreneurial Decision-Making, AI Adoption, Entrepreneurial Performance"}, "authors": [{"id": "2406886961", "name": "S.

Since the detection of depression is currently based largely on subjective self-reporting, there is an urgent need for fast, objective, and reliable detection methods. In our study, we present an artificial intelligence-based system that combines iris-based identification with the analysis of pupillometric and eye movement biomarkers, enabling the real-time detection of physiological signs of depression before driving or flying. The two-module model was evaluated based on data from 242 participants: the iris identification module operated with an Equal Error Rate of less than 0.5%, while the depression-detecting CNN-LSTM network achieved 89% accuracy and an AUC value of 0.94. Compared to the neutral state, depressed individuals responded to negative news with significantly greater pupil dilation (+27.9% vs. +18.4%), while showing a reduced or minimal response to positive stimuli (−1.3% vs. +6.2%). This was complemented by slower saccadic movement and longer fixation time, which is consistent with the cognitive distortions characteristic of depression. Our results indicate that pupillometric deviations relative to individual baselines can be reliably detected and used with high accuracy for depression screening. The presented system offers a preventive safety solution that could reduce the number of accidents caused by human error related to depression in road and air traffic in the future."}, "authors": [{"id": "2275822217", "name": "Gábor Kiss"}, {"id": "2382180507", "name": "Patrik Viktor"}], "fields_of_study": ["Medicine"]}

In this study, a total of 675 students from six Romanian universities answered a self-administered online questionnaire evaluating three main aspects: AI acceptance, AI benefits, and AI skepticism. While AI skepticism has a modest but substantial negative influence (β = −0.113, p = 0.001), results show that AI benefits favorably predict AI acceptance (β = 0.541, p = 0.001). Whereas AI skepticism negatively correlates with AI acceptance (r = −0.124, p = 0.001), correlational analysis reveals a high positive association between AI acceptance and AI benefits (r = 0.544, p = 0.001). Despite concerns about its limitations, the regression model suggests that students’ willingness to embrace AI in education is mostly driven by its perceived advantages. This explains 30.8% of the variance in AI acceptance (R2 = 0.308, F(2, 641) = 142.909, p < 0.001). These results highlight the importance of techniques that improve perceived benefits while addressing uncertainty since they offer insightful analysis of student attitudes regarding artificial intelligence integration in higher education.

This review aims to be an authoritative, critical, and accessible review and discussion of general interest to the drug repurposing community concerning the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools. Emerging questions include what is achievable with AI in this domain and what its impact will be, what AI and ML embrace, and how we, as geneticists, pharmacologists, and computational scientists, can contribute to the discovery of new, inexpensive, and affordable repurposable medicines. The fast growth of genetics and multiomics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and radiomics) and electronic health records in diverse populations contributes to answering questions, including how to rapidly identify effective repurposable medicines, what a clinically meaningful effect size in trials is, and what the potential implications for precision medicine are.

Conventional fraud investigation methods, which largely rely on AI-driven tools combined with manual legal analysis, often suffer from limited efficiency, scalability, and adaptability when addressing evolving financial fraud patterns. In this study, a hybrid AI-driven framework is proposed to effectively bridge financial fraud investigation and legal analysis. The proposed model integrates AI-based analytical systems with legal reasoning mechanisms to enhance the accuracy and reliability of fraud investigations. The framework has been validated using real-world financial fraud cases and legal investigation records. The results demonstrate that integrating AI-driven systems with fraud investigation processes significantly improves detection accuracy and accelerates investigation timelines. Moreover, the proposed approach enhances the efficiency of financial fraud case analysis by leveraging AI for legal interpretation and decision support. This study also addresses key challenges associated with the application of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in judicial contexts. By narrowing the gap between AI-based fraud detection and legal enforcement, the proposed framework contributes to making fraud investigations more transparent, accountable, and legally defensible. The findings confirm that the approach is effective in strengthening forensic financial investigations, reducing investigative effort, and ensuring compliance with continuously evolving financial regulations. Furthermore, sustainability is emphasized as a critical consideration in modern fraud investigation practices. The adoption of artificial intelligence within sustainable legal frameworks may support long-term regulatory compliance and responsible financial governance."}, "authors": [{"id": "2635197", "name": "B.

We propose a three-tier failure taxonomy that distinguishes between input-level anomalies, processing-level errors, and output-level inconsistencies, each requiring distinct detection and recovery strategies. The proposed architecture integrates continuous self-monitoring components, confidence estimation modules, and adaptive recovery mechanisms that enable graceful degradation rather than catastrophic failure. Building upon prior work in modular robotic system architectures and patented approaches to dexterous task execution, we present design principles for building failure-resilient AI systems, including redundancy patterns, fallback hierarchies, and human-in-the-loop escalation protocols. Evaluation through simulated failure injection across multiple AI task domains demonstrates that failure-aware systems maintain operational continuity in 87% of induced failure scenarios, compared to 23% for conventional architectures.

In the preoperative domain, AI-driven risk stratification models inform patient selection and resource allocation, while parallel advances in deep learning-enabled anatomic segmentation and three-dimensional reconstruction have the potential to streamline surgical planning by automating labor-intensive imaging workflows. Intraoperatively, maturing capabilities in phase recognition, anatomic identification, augmented reality overlay, and real-time decision support demonstrate the possibility for improved safety, workflow efficiency, and early recognition of surgical and physiologic challenges.

Whereas earlier AI architectures executed fixed task specifications, agentic systems maintain recursive loops of perception, evaluation, goal-updating, and action, allowing them to sustain and adapt purposive activity across temporal and organizational scales. This paper argues that Agentic AI is not an incremental extension of large language models (LLMs) or autonomous agents in the sense we know it from classical AI and multi-agent systems, but a reconstitution of agency itself within computational substrates. Building on the logic of coordination, delegation, and self-regulation developed in early agent-based process management systems, we propose a general theory of synthetic purposiveness, where agency emerges as a distributed and self-maintaining property of artificial systems operating in open-ended environments. We develop the concept of synthetic teleology—the engineered capacity of artificial systems to generate and regulate goals through ongoing self-evaluation—and we formalize its dynamics through a recursive goal-maintenance equation. We further outline design patterns, computational semantics, and measurable indicators of purposiveness (e.g., teleological coherence, adaptive recovery, and reflective efficiency), providing a foundation for the systematic design and empirical investigation of agentic behaviour. By reclaiming agency as a first-class construct in artificial intelligence, we argue for a paradigm shift from algorithmic optimization toward goal-directed reasoning and purposive orchestration—one with far-reaching epistemic, societal, and institutional consequences."}, "authors": [{"id": "1484693012", "name": "Tsehaye Haidemariam"}], "fields_of_study": ["Medicine"]}

In this Personal Account, I argue that dataset construction plays a central role in AI‐driven chemistry, not merely as a preparatory step but as a means of formalizing new chemical learning problems. I summarize recent efforts to build machine‐learning‐ready datasets in three domains: molecular property prediction, property‐conditioned molecular design, and reaction mechanism prediction. Experimentally measured optical property datasets were curated to explicitly incorporate environmental context, enabling models to learn structure–environment–property relationships that reflect real experimental conditions and to support inverse design of functional chromophores. For chemical reactivity, large‐scale mechanistic datasets were constructed through rule‐based imputation of elementary steps, transforming overall reactions into supervised learning problems for mechanism prediction. Limitations of sequence‐based reaction models motivated the development of FlowER, which represents reactions as electron redistribution processes using bond–electron matrices and enforces mass conservation by construction, allowing direct integration with quantum chemical validation. Together, these studies illustrate a unifying perspective in which datasets, representations, models, and downstream workflows are designed jointly, guided by chemical intuition. By framing dataset construction as an act of problem definition, this Account highlights how chemists can shape the scope and direction of artificial intelligence as a tool for chemical discovery."}, "authors": [{"id": "39583381", "name": "J.

A mixed-methods intervention was conducted with 39 graduate students enrolled in the Master of Arts Major in Educational Management, who participated in a 20-hour AI literacy and ethics course embedded in a Graduate Seminar. To capture the Philippine education realities often overlooked in global frameworks, a researcher-developed questionnaire was employed to reconceptualize and measure AI literacy and ethical preparedness in the local context. Quantitative results showed significant improvements, with Artificial Intelligence literacy mediating the relationship between ethical preparedness and artificial intelligence literacy (β = .46, p < .001). Qualitative insights through classroom observations illustrated how students translated abstract principles into situated judgment. This paper extends AI ethics discourse by reframing it not only as a matter of principles but also as a function of operational literacies that enable educators to exercise situated ethical judgment, especially within local contexts."}, "authors": [{"id": "2339896620", "name": "Artemio L.

However, its long-term impact remains underexplored. This study conducts a bibliometric and predictive analysis of -driven sports research over the past decade, identifying key contributors, emerging trends, and future directions through visualization techniques. Method: A systematic review was conducted on related sports research from 2014 to 2024 using the Web of Science Core Collection. Bibliometric tools Citespace and Vosviewer were employed to analyze publication trends, author networks, institutional collaborations, and keyword co-occurrences. Polynomial regression analysis was applied to forecast future research growth based on historical publication and citation trends. A total of 5,811 publications with 96,753 citations were identified. China, the United States, and the United Kingdom were the most productive countries, with China leading in volume but exhibiting lower citation impact. The Chinese Academy of Sciences, Stanford University, and the University of Oxford were the top research institutions. Keyword analysis revealed that \"machine learning,\" \"deep learning,\" and \"computer vision\" were the most studied topics, while emerging themes such as \"stress analysis,\" \"information processing,\" and \"pose estimation\" indicated shifts towards driven real-time monitoring and predictive analytics. Polynomial regression models predicted continued research growth, with publication trends following y = 354x\n ²\n + 1350x + 528 (r\n ²\n = 0.94) and citation growth modeled as y = 9680x\n ²\n + 24900x + 7850 (r\n ²\n = 0.99), suggesting sustained acceleration in AI applications within sports science. The integration of sports science has grown rapidly, with machine learning and computer vision playing a pivotal role in optimizing athletic performance, real-time feedback, and injury prevention. Predictive analytics and driven modeling can transform sports training by personalizing programs based on biomechanical and physiological data, enhancing both performance and injury resilience. However, disparities in AI adoption across regions and institutions highlight the need for greater international collaboration, particularly in developing regions where access to driven sports technologies is limited. Future research should refine -driven models for individualized training, integrate wearable sensor data for precision, and address ethical concerns. Additionally, policymakers and sports organizations should invest in AI-based training and health monitoring systems to bridge the gap between technology-rich and technology-limited regions. As it evolves, its role in sports science will expand, driving advancements in performance analysis, health monitoring, and strategic decision-making.\n"}, "authors": [{"id": "2372697918", "name": "Wanli Zang"}, {"id": "2405383070", "name": "Qiuxia Zhang"}], "fields_of_study": null}

The state, as the most powerful tool for organizing social processes, cannot but pay attention to innovations that permeate almost all spheres of society. Artificial intelligence provides the state with new tools, but it also requires government influence in order to ensure the security of society and regulate changing social relations. The purpose of the article is to conduct a theoretical analysis and determine the optimal model of government intervention in the formation of legal norms that regulate public relations arising in connection with the creation and application of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The conducted theoretical analysis allows us to conclude that the role of the state in regulating legal relations related to AI should be fundamentally new — not absolutely limiting but guiding and ensuring the development of these technologies. The State needs to create an adaptive legal environment based on relevant ethical and legal principles, which should be based on stimulating innovation and mandatory consideration of risks to society. State standards in the field of AI are of fundamental importance today, outlining the contours for future legal regulation through laws and regulations. There is an obvious need to introduce flexible regulatory models, such as experimental legal regimes, which will allow law to evolve synchronously with technological progress, ensuring legal certainty and protection of public and private interests."}, "authors": [{"id": "2248167812", "name": "A.

This interaction began with the early arrival of Islam through Yemeni merchants and preachers who carried the scholarly legacy of Shāfiʿī jurisprudence and Sunni Sufism. The research explores the concept of Malay Islamic knowledge and investigates how it responds to the profound transformations brought about by artificial intelligence, as an intellectual product reflecting the unique experience of Islamic communities in the Malay world. The study aims to define Malay Islamic knowledge and analyze the challenges and opportunities imposed by the rise of artificial intelligence on its structure and functions. It proposes a Maqāṣid-based framework for renewing this knowledge and ensuring its continuity by integrating research induction with linguistic and historical analysis, grounded in scriptural texts and the principles of Islamic law. Artificial intelligence is viewed not as a threat, but as a tool that can be harnessed to serve Islamic knowledge in a manner compatible with contemporary needs while preserving Islamic foundations and values. The research presents a Maqāṣid-oriented approach capable of accommodating digital transformations, relying on higher objectives of Sharia and legal maxims to guide renewal and regulate engagement with modern technologies. It concludes that Malay Islamic knowledge—with its civilizational uniqueness, historical depth, and well-established Sharīʿah objectives—is well-positioned to provide a knowledge model capable of contributing to the renewal and development of Islamic thought, and guiding the interaction with technological changes. This is achieved through a civilizational renewal project that safeguards foundational constants, directs evolving variables, and employs artificial intelligence in a conscious, Maqāṣid-based manner, enabling this knowledge to play an effective role in shaping Islamic civilization, preserving identity, and confronting cultural alienation."}, "authors": [{"id": "2316077071", "name": "A.

This study introduces an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for age-stratified mental health risk prediction using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). Using the Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI) dataset, the study stratifies individuals into five different age groups (18-55+ years) and applies machine learning models - Random Forest, extreme gradient boosting, and support vector machine - enhanced with SHAP to identify key predictors across life stages. The findings reveal significant variations in risk factors: younger adults (18-24) are influenced by social support, while familial history and past mental health disorders gain prominence in middle-aged groups (25-54). For older adults (55+), social networks and environmental stressors become critical. Unlike traditional «black box» AI models, SHAP provides interpretable insights, ensuring transparency in predictive decision-making. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating that mental health risks are not static but evolve with age, necessitating tailored interventions. The framework advances age-specific predictive modelling and offers actionable insights for policymakers and clinicians, particularly in resource-constrained settings. By addressing the limitations of conventional AI approaches, this research establishes a foundation for personalised, explainable, and effective mental health risk assessment across diverse populations. The integration of XAI with age stratification sets a new benchmark for mental health research, highlighting the transformative potential of AI-driven, context-sensitive solutions in addressing the global burden of mental health disorders."}, "authors": [{"id": "2222068278", "name": "Tsholofelo Mokheleli"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Artificial intelligence can automate routine tasks (such as data entry and preparing returns), which can reduce errors and increase efficiency. Tax teams currently spend a significant amount of their time collecting and manipulating data, which artificial intelligence can do in a fraction of the time. Automation allows professionals to focus on higher value-added analytical and advisory tasks. Tax authorities actively use artificial intelligence for predictive analytics and network research to detect suspected tax evasion and fraud. Artificial intelligence helps analyse large amounts of financial data and identify suspicious patterns, making audits faster and more accurate. The introduction of a global minimum tax is an extremely complex and data-intensive process, for which multinational companies use artificial intelligence-based software to automate calculations and predict tax burdens. Companies that do not integrate artificial intelligence may find themselves at a significant competitive disadvantage. It is important to examine the legal and ethical framework for the use of artificial intelligence in taxation, ensuring transparency, data protection and algorithmic impartiality to avoid discriminatory bias.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as one of the most influential technologies shaping the contemporary world. In the field of graphic design, AI has introduced new methods of visual creation, transformed traditional design processes and redefined the relationship between human creativity and digital tools. This research paper examines the role of artificial intelligence in graphic design, focusing on its impact on creativity, efficiency, innovation, and ethical considerations. AI-powered tools such as generative design systems, automated layout software, intelligent image-editing applications, and data-driven design platforms have enabled designers to work faster, experiment more freely, and produce personalized visual content. While these advancements enhance productivity and expand creative possibilities, they also raise concerns regarding originality, authorship, over-dependence on technology, and the potential dilution of human intuition. This study adopts a qualitative and analytical approach to explore the advantages and limitations of AI in graphic design. The paper argues that artificial intelligence should be perceived not as a replacement for designers, but as a collaborative partner that complements human imagination. Ultimately, the balanced integration of AI and human creativity can lead to a more adaptive, innovative, and ethically responsible future for graphic design."}, "authors": [{"id": "2406593874", "name": "Satyam Tripathi"}], "fields_of_study": null}

This narrative review assessed artificial intelligence applications across the surgical stages of care in breast cancer surgery, including preoperative planning, intraoperative assistance, and postoperative care. A structured literature search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science over the past 15 years was conducted to identify studies on artificial intelligence applications across all stages of breast cancer surgery. In the preoperative phase, artificial intelligence contributes to tumor detection, segmentation, and surgical margin assessment through advanced imaging and predictive modeling. During surgery, real-time image-guided systems and robotic platforms powered by machine learning enable greater accuracy and intraoperative decision support. Postoperatively, artificial intelligence–driven tools aid in complication prediction, recurrence monitoring, and follow-up personalization, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing variability in care. Integration of multimodal artificial intelligence approaches from imaging, robotics, and predictive analytics across the surgical continuum can help highlight translational gaps and evaluate clinical readiness, providing insights that have not been emphasized in previous reviews. Despite these advancements, many artificial intelligence applications remain in early research stages or have limited clinical use, facing challenges in data standardization, model interpretability, ethics, and integration into practice. Clinical impact depends on infrastructure, surgeon expertise, and regulations. Nevertheless, interdisciplinary collaboration allows artificial intelligence to enhance accuracy, reduce complications, and improve patient-centered care in breast cancer surgery."}, "authors": [{"id": "1491208457", "name": "Mahtab Khajeh"}, {"id": "7742723", "name": "P.

The main attention is paid to the problem of correlation between efficiency and transparency of intellectual systems. The study considers the phenomenon of decreasing explainability of solutions when the complexity of artificial intelligence systems increases. The author analyzes this phenomenon not as a technological limitation, but as a fundamental property of complex cognitive systems. The study is based on a comparative analysis of decision-making processes in natural and artificial intelligence, which makes it possible to identify common regularities of their functioning. Special attention is paid to the study of parallels between natural cognitive processes and the work of modern neural networks. Current problems of verification and validation of intelligent systems under conditions of their increasing complexity are considered. The influence of digital transformation on the development of new approaches to assessing the reliability of artificial intelligence systems is studied. A verification system based on four key criteria has been developed: stability of results, correctness of behavior in boundary conditions, robustness of solutions and the possibility of external validation. The existence of a fundamental relationship between the efficiency of intellectual systems and the inevitable decrease in their explainability is proved. The necessity of transition from traditional verification methods to more flexible approaches that take into account the specificity of complex cognitive systems is substantiated. The proposed methodology opens new perspectives for development and implementation of artificial intelligence systems in the conditions of digital transformation of society. The study makes a significant contribution to the development of the philosophy of artificial intelligence and offers practical solutions for assessing the reliability of intelligent systems.

The data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling–Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS 3). The results reveal that AI implementation has a significant direct effect on job stability. Moreover, AI implementation significantly increases job polarization, which negatively affects job stability, while simultaneously enhancing access to training, which positively influences job stability. The mediation analysis demonstrates that job polarization and access to training partially mediate the relationship between AI implementation and job stability, with access to training exhibiting a stronger mediating effect.

The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly transformed demand forecasting by enabling advanced learning from large, heterogeneous datasets through machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and hybrid analytical models. Within the context of Saudi Arabia’s industrial sectors—shaped by Vision 2030 objectives of economic diversification, industrial localization, and digital transformation—AI-driven demand forecasting presents a strategic mechanism for improving planning accuracy and operational resilience. This study examines the theoretical foundations, model architectures, implementation considerations, and strategic benefits of AI-based demand forecasting in Saudi industrial supply chains. It further discusses integration with digital platforms, real-time analytics, and multi-source data fusion. A conceptual deployment framework is proposed to demonstrate how AI forecasting can enhance planning accuracy, reduce inventory inefficiencies, and support national supply chain development goals."}, "authors": [{"id": "2400422520", "name": "Samir Ali Syed"}], "fields_of_study": null}

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technologies offers novel approaches to optimize real-time nitric oxide monitoring, dosing regimens, and toxicity prediction. Current interdisciplinary research on the artificial intelligence-driven nitric oxide intersection remains fragmented, with a lack of systematic investigations into knowledge architecture, technological evolution, and translational barriers. This study addressed this critical gap by presenting the knowledge graph-based analysis of artificial intelligence-driven nitric oxide system. A total of 384 relevant articles (2005-2024) were retrieved in the Web of Science Core Collection and analyzed using CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and Bibliometrix R package. Annual publications demonstrated a biphasic growth, accelerating after 2017 in tandem with breakthroughs in artificial intelligence architectures. Although China and the United States were dominated in this field, international collaborations exhibited a core-periphery structure. Research themes predominantly focused on cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, with underdeveloped applications in neuroimmunology and infectious diseases. Highly cited literature that emphasized photodynamic therapy and disease risk assessment revealed insufficient integration between artificial intelligence algorithms and fundamental nitric oxide mechanisms. Keyword evolution analysis identified a paradigm shift from traditional mechanisms (e.g., \"blood pressure,\" \"inflammation\") to technology-driven approaches (e.g., \"machine learning, \" \"deep learning\"). Clinical translation has faced challenges, including data heterogeneity, algorithm interpretability, and deficiencies in multicenter validation. This pioneering study systematically delineates the knowledge framework and translational bottlenecks in artificial intelligence-driven nitric oxide convergence. Future research should prioritize artificial intelligence modeling of nitric oxide dynamic metabolism, the development of explainable algorithms, and prospective clinical trials to bridge the laboratory-to-clinic gap."}, "authors": [{"id": "2385605913", "name": "Zhen Liu"}, {"id": "2385690636", "name": "Ainikaer Abulaiti"}, {"id": "2386664344", "name": "Yan Zhao"}, {"id": "2385643628", "name": "Junting Zang"}, {"id": "2385601869", "name": "Guohua Li"}, {"id": "2299048546", "name": "Li Shu"}, {"id": "1691699277", "name": "Paerhati Wahafu"}, {"id": "1658980621", "name": "Maihemuti Yakufu"}], "fields_of_study": ["Medicine"]}

In an era where technological autonomy exceeds the limits of direct control, the classical notion of responsibility loses its center, becoming a problem without a subject. This paper explores the tension between algorithmic rationality and moral consciousness, starting from the idea that morality presupposes intentionality, empathy, and self-awareness-dimensions that machines cannot reproduce.\nThe analysis traces the evolution of the concept of responsibility in the philosophical tradition, from Kant and Jonas to the ethics of modern technology, showing that morality cannot be reduced to calculation. Although autonomous systems may make decisions that are procedurally correct, they remain incapable of grasping the moral meaning of action. Therefore, moral responsibility in the age of artificial intelligence must be reconstructed not as a delegation to machines, but as an extension of human responsibility into the technological sphere.\nThe article argues that the real problem is not whether machines can make mistakes, but whether humans are still capable of understanding error as an ethical experience. In the absence of a consciousness capable of assuming moral weight, responsibility risks dissolving into a moral void. Confronted with this crisis, the ethics of the future must once again become an ethics of limits-one that recognizes where power ends and duty begins."}, "authors": [{"id": "2377015948", "name": "Mariana-Alina Zisu"}, {"id": "2405589621", "name": "Rodica-Raluca Ștefănoaia"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Beyond morphological classification the review points out AI use in reading flow cytometry data and in predicting blood cancers such as Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS). The future of AI in hematopathology depends on combining data types. In that approach AI algorithms merge data, with immunophenotypic data, cytogenetic data and molecular profiles.

AI methods may enable the dynamic recognition of complex time-frequency EEG patterns and the adaptation of monitoring strategies to patient-specific brain responses. Convolutional neural networks, artificial neural networks, and hybrid deep learning models have reported encouraging results in detecting anesthetic states, estimating bispectral index values, and identifying relevant EEG features - such as alpha-delta shifts or burst suppression - without relying on manual feature engineering.

Artificial intelligence-based tools for automated large vessel occlusion (LVO) detection have shown promising results in improving stroke workflow metrics, yet data from low-volume PSCs remain limited.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nThis study presents a multicenter, retrospective analysis of 109 AIS patients transferred for anterior circulation LVO MT from five low-volume PSCs in Poland over a 53-month period (≤ 1 MT transfer/center/month). Standard imaging was retrospectively assessed using Brainomix 360 (Brainomix USA Inc., Chicago, USA) to assess early ischemic changes, collateral status, and LVO location. Two blinded vascular neurologists independently simulated transfer decisions based on post-processed imaging. Large vessel occlusion detection sensitivity and potential changes in transfer eligibility were analyzed. The workflow time parameters were compared to the comprehensive stroke center (CSC) cohort with a routine AI-assisted evaluation (n = 69). The maximal expected time benefit from AI implementation was also estimated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nArtificial intelligence-based sensitivity for anterior circulation LVO detection was 83.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 76.5-90.5], significantly higher for M1 than for internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusions (95.2% vs. 63.9%, p < 0.01). Among included patients, 78.9% (95% CI 70.3-85.5) were simulated as eligible and could potentially benefit from shorter workflow times. This is supported by the significantly shorter computed tomography angiography (CTA) to endovascular treatment (EVT) notification time in the CSC cohort with routine AI-assisted imaging compared with the low-volume PSC (11 vs. 48 min, p < 0.01). The median maximal potential reduction in door-in-door-out (DIDO) time was estimated at 30 min [interquartile range (IQR) 4-45). In contrast, 4.6% (95% CI 2.0-10.3) individuals were reclassified as ineligible due to extensive early ischemic changes and poor collaterals, potentially avoiding futile transfer.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nArtificial intelligence-assisted imaging may significantly improve transfer decisions and workflow efficiency in low-volume PSCs, particularly in settings without real-time radiological interpretation. Its broader adoption may strengthen MT eligibility assessment within regional stroke networks."}, "authors": [{"id": "102938777", "name": "M.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have demonstrated promising improvements in the diagnostic accuracy of imaging for PH, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94, compared to seasoned professionals. Research objective To systematically synthesize available evidence on the comparative accuracy of AI versus manual interpretation in detecting PH across various chest imaging modalities, i.e., chest X-ray, echocardiography, CT scan and cardiac MRI. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted across five databases—PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library—from inception through March 2025. Statistical analysis was performed using R (version 2024.12.1 + 563) with 2 × 2 contingency data. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were pooled using a bivariate random-effects model (reitsma() from the mada package), while the AUC were meta-analyzed using logit-transformed values via the metagen() function from the meta package. Results This meta-analysis of 12 studies, encompassing 7,459 patients, demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy of PH with AI integration, evidenced by a logit mean difference in AUC of 0.43 (95% CI: 0.23–0.64; p < 0.0001) and low heterogeneity (I2 = 21.0%, τ2 < 0.0001, p = 0.2090), which was consolidated by pooled AUC of 0.934 on bivariate model. Pooled sensitivity and specificity for AI models were 0.83 (95% CI: 0.73–0.90) and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86–0.95), respectively, with substantial heterogeneity for sensitivity (I2 = 83.8%, τ2 = 0.4934, p < 0.0001) and moderate for specificity (I2 = 41.5%, τ2 = 0.1015, p = 0.1146); the diagnostic odds ratio was 54.26 (95% CI: 22.50–130.87) with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 70.7%, τ2 = 0.8451, p = 0.0023). Sensitivity analysis showed stable estimates and did not reduce heterogeneity across outcomes. Conclusion AI-integrated imaging significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy for pulmonary hypertension, with higher sensitivity (0.83) and specificity (0.91) compared to manual interpretation across chest imaging modalities.

The evolution of management approaches is analyzed: from traditional models to adaptive management and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI). The role of digital technologies (Big Data, Blockchain, IoT, autonomous systems) in ensuring supply chain resilience is defined. The benefits and risks of implementing intelligent systems are discussed, particularly in the context of demand forecasting, route optimization, and warehouse automation. Based on the analysis of practical cases of global leaders (Amazon, Tesla), the necessity of transitioning to hybrid management models combining human intelligence with algorithmic solutions to enhance global competitiveness is substantiated. The primary objective of this research is to analyze the evolution of management approaches, tracing the trajectory from traditional models to adaptive management, and ultimately to the full-scale integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The study aims to define the specific role of digital technologies in enhancing supply chain resilience and to evaluate the necessity of new management frameworks. he authors conclude that adopting such hybrid approaches is essential for companies aiming to enhance their global competitiveness and adapt to the volatility of modern markets.Furthermore, the article provides a critical assessment of the operational shifts required for modern logistics managers. It argues that the integration of artificial intelligence should not be viewed merely as a technical upgrade, but as a strategic imperative that redefines organizational hierarchies. By analyzing the «human-in-the-loop» methodologies employed by market leaders like Amazon and Tesla, the study highlights that the most effective supply chain models are those that leverage AI for high-speed data processing and routine automation, while reserving complex, high-level decision-making for human experts. This distinction is presented as a crucial factor in mitigating the risks associated with total automation and ensuring adaptive capacity in a volatile global market."}, "authors": [{"id": "118776030", "name": "Oksana Verstiak"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Drawing from the Siva Purana (trans. Shastri, 1970) and the humanistic philosophies of Sri Aurobindo, Swami Vivekananda, and Deendayal Upadhyaya, the study examines how consciousness, compassion, and detachment - core tenets of Sivas persona - can serve as ethical anchors in the age of intelligent machines. Modern AI ethics emphasizes fairness, transparency, accountability, and human autonomy, yet often lacks a cohesive philosophical anthropology to define what it means to act, know, and value. By integrating Shivas vision of divine-human unity with Integral Humanism, the paper proposes a spiritually informed model of ethical intelligence rooted in awareness, universal compassion, and moral equilibrium. Through this framework, AI is re-conceptualized not merely as a technological tool but as a moral extension of human consciousness, capable of reflecting dharmic values that sustain collective welfare and ecological harmony. Shivas acts exemplify compassionate rationality that transcends rigid utilitarianism. This study argues that grounding AI development in Shivas humanism transforms algorithmic governance from procedural compliance into reflective moral action, ensuring that artificial systems uphold dignity, justice, and spiritual evolution. By aligning technological progress with the cosmic ethics of interconnectedness and balance, the paper concludes that Shivas humanism offers a transformative paradigm for reuniting intelligence and empathy in the digital age."}, "authors": [{"id": "2406997452", "name": "Nandini Bhartiya"}, {"id": "2406997479", "name": "Dr. Vivek Mehrotra"}], "fields_of_study": null}

This review synthesizes current research at the nexus of neuroscience and architecture, with a focus on how emerging virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are being utilized to understand and enhance human spatial experience. We systematically reviewed literature from 2015 to 2025, identifying key empirical studies and categorizing advances into three themes: core components of neuroarchitectural research; the use of physiological sensors (e.g., EEG, heart rate variability) and virtual reality to gather data on occupant responses; and the integration of neuroscience with AI-driven analysis. Findings indicate that built environment elements (e.g., geometry, curvature, lighting) influence brain activity in regions governing emotion, stress, and cognition. VR-based experiments combined with neuroimaging and physiological measures enable ecologically valid, fine-grained analysis of these effects, while AI techniques facilitate real-time emotion recognition and large-scale pattern discovery, bridging design features with occupant emotional responses. However, the current evidence base remains nascent, limited by small, homogeneous samples and fragmented data. We propose a four-domain framework (somatic, psychological, emotional, cognitive-“SPEC”) to guide future research. By consolidating methodological advances in VR experimentation, physiological sensing, and AI-based analytics, this review provides an integrative roadmap for replicable and scalable neuroarchitectural studies. Intensified interdisciplinary efforts leveraging AI and VR are needed to build robust, diverse datasets and develop neuro-informed design tools.

It argues that AI enhances human cognitive capabilities by expanding processes of conceptual organization, critical literature analysis, argumentative structuring, and textual revision, without replacing the intellectual and ethical role of the researcher. It concludes that the conscious adoption of AI as an amplifying cognitive agent represents a structural evolution in the modes of production, validation, and dissemination of scientific knowledge."}, "authors": [{"id": "2396009718", "name": "Tadeu Marcos Borges Paes"}, {"id": "2406640078", "name": "Marcos Sergio Souza Borges"}], "fields_of_study": null}

These serious risks threaten human safety and infrastructure, with traditional post-earthquake damage assessments being slow, costly, and sometimes hazardous. This paper summarizes recently developed methods and theories in the developing direction for applications of artificial intelligence in civil engineering, including in simulating and predicting structural damage following seismic events. AI enables rapid and accurate assessment of building damage by collected a lot of data from global earthquake networks and, using methods such as leveraging machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL),  artificial neural networks (ANNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM). AI-based approaches offer significant improvements in prediction accuracy, accelerate post-earthquake response, and early warning integration. By these strategies seismic disaster mitigation can be during a pre-earthquake, and be executed at the time of an earthquake and post-earthquake. The research problem is defined in the following main question: Can we, through the use of artificial Intelligence, predict earthquakes, mitigate disaster risks, avoid human losses, and protect buildings and facilities from collapses that cause loss of life and property?  This research aims to study the seismic behavior predicted by artificial intelligence applications for concrete structures as a result of repeated seismic wave loads imposed on them and to know their ability to resist the effects of these waves, represented by shear, torsional, bending and moments forces. This study also aims to evaluate the limits contained in some international codes and compare them with the values predicted by artificial intelligence applications. These codes include the American code ACI-14, the second European code EC-2, and the Egyptian code ECP-2017."}, "authors": [{"id": "2405955910", "name": "Najat Marami"}, {"id": "2405955817", "name": "Zahra Al-Hanashi"}, {"id": "2405955902", "name": "Sumia Alghlam"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Also known as AI, artificial intelligence is used every day in an increasing number of tasks. However, AI is also a controversial topic. Despite its many benefits, specialists also warn of its risks. Amid this debate, numerous projects continue to explore new and more complex uses for this technology. One of these areas is the administration of justice. From its use as a legal information search tool to its potential deployment as an artificial judge or mediator, AI undoubtedly has the potential to bring about profound changes in the justice system in the future. In this context, the present study seeks to analyze the suitability of the current Mexican legal framework both to leverage the opportunities offered by artificial intelligence and to address its challenges in the administration of justice. To this end, the case of the new civil and family justice model, which will begin upon the entry into force of the National Code of Civil and Family Procedure projected for April 2027, will be used. It is worth mentioning that the choice of civil and family procedural law is not accidental; on the contrary, the new Code stands out, among other innovations, for its special emphasis on implementing digital justice and using information and communication technologies."}, "authors": [{"id": null, "name": "Luisa Córdova Marín"}, {"id": null, "name": "Alfonso Calcáneo Sánchez"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Traditional performance\nappraisal methods remain infrequent, biased, and disengaging, while AI-based systems risk dehumanization and\nalgorithmic bias if not ethically guided. This paper seeks to bridge this divide by proposing a comprehensive model that\nharmonizes data-driven analytics with empathetic, human-led management practices.\nObjective: The study aims to develop and present the Integrated Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI)\nPerformance & Development Model, a conceptual framework designed to operationalize the principles of HCAI\nin performance evaluation and learning systems. The model seeks to transform performance management from a\ncompliance-oriented activity into a continuous, developmental, and ethically grounded process.\nMethodology: Employing a conceptual research design, this paper utilizes a theory-building approach based on the\nsystematic synthesis and thematic analysis of existing scholarship in AI analytics, continuous performance feedback,\nmotivational theory, and managerial coaching. The resulting model was constructed through iterative conceptual\nintegration, informed by both empirical studies and theoretical frameworks, and elaborated using descriptive narrative\nsupported by a visual schematic.\nFindings:The research introduces the Integrated HCAI Performance & Development Model, comprising four\ninterdependent components:\n(1) the AI-Powered Analytics Engine, which aggregates multidimensional performance data to identify trends, skill\ngaps, and development opportunities;\n(2) the Human-Centered Interpretation Layer, where managers apply empathetic judgment to contextualize AI-generated\ninsights;\n(3) the Continuous Feedback & Development Loop, which facilitates ongoing dialogue and co-created learning plans;\nand\n(4) the Strategic HR Policy Foundation, ensuring ethical integrity, transparency, and fairness. Collectively, these\ncomponents align organizational policies with human-centered, technology-enhanced practices. Conclusion: The model provides an actionable framework for integrating intelligent analytics and human empathy to\nenhance performance management and employee development. It underscores the pivotal role of strategic HR leadership\nin ethically governing AI systems and cultivating a culture of psychological safety and learning.

Multi-level artificial intelligence technologies, based on algorithms and driven by data, are becoming an extremely valuable tool for achieving educational goals, including language learning.\n The purpose of this article\n is to identify the specific features of integrating artificial intelligence technologies into teaching Russian as a foreign language at the pre-university level and to explore foreign language learners' perceptions of the didactic potential of modern artificial intelligence in foreign language learning. The research's scientific novelty lies in its focus not only on the objective didactic application of artificial intelligence in teaching Russian as a foreign language, but also on the subjective perception of its potential by key participants in the educational process –foreign language learners at the pre-university level.\n The study utilized\n general scientific research methods (analysis, generalization), survey methods, and statistical methods. The empirical basis of the study consisted of responses from international students in the preparatory faculty, as part of a survey designed to assess students' attitudes toward artificial intelligence, their perception of the usefulness of technologies for developing language and speech skills, and identify potential barriers to their use.\n The study's results\n demonstrate a relatively high level of interest among foreign language learners in using AI assistants to personalize learning and develop speaking skills, but also highlight a lack of systematic pedagogical guidance for this process. The study concludes that it is necessary to develop an integrated methodological model that combines the advantages of artificial intelligence with traditional pedagogical approaches.\n"}, "authors": [{"id": "2276713380", "name": "I.

The AI systems made to date are characterized by massive power demands which provide pressure on the energy systems of the world and add to climate change, which is an inherent contradiction between technology development and the environment. This review of the literature explores 542 current articles to analyze the new paradigm of Green Artificial Intelligence as a group to make AI innovation and environmental stewardship align through energy-saving algorithms, green computing methods, and climate-aware implementation models. Our methodological approach was based on the PRISMA system, as we searched databases and filtered 1,052 records and finally settled on 534 articles, which directly relate to the topic of AI and sustainability. In our analysis, it is possible to note a tremendous advancement of energy-saving machine learning algorithms, green data centers, the integration of renewable energy usage, and artificial intelligence usage to monitor the environment and take climate action. Nevertheless, there exist decisive loopholes in the standardized measurement systems, lifecycle assessment approaches, harmonization of policies and fair access of green AI innovations in developing economies. The contribution of this review is the observation of seven major areas of implementation, the assessment of the emergent methods of energy optimization, issues of implementation and a hierarchical research agenda. "}, "authors": [{"id": null, "name": "Dimple Ravindra Patil"}, {"id": "2094038990", "name": "N.

Various doctrinal conceptions about whether artificial intelligence is a separate legal subject or not and competing approaches to defining its legal status, the notions of an “electronic person” and a “quasi-subject” in particular, are analyzed. The conclusion is that it is necessary to establish an effective legal framework to regulate the use of artificial intelligence technologies based on an anthropocentric approach that places the protection of human rights and interests at the forefront of all interactions with technology.

However, under the traditional medical model, patients' understanding of the right to know is limited to the clinician's obligation to inform, and it is difficult to adapt to the new diagnosis and treatment model with highly opaque algorithm decision-making and diversified responsible subjects. In artificial intelligence diagnosis and treatment, patients' right to know should be extended to knowledge of data sources, algorithm logic, differences in man-machine judgment and other dimensions. However, in practice, they face dilemmas such as algorithm black boxes, ownership of rights and responsibilities, and professional barriers. In this regard, it is necessary to establish a hierarchical disclosure system for diagnosis and treatment algorithm information, clarify the rules for dividing the notification obligations of developers, institutions and doctors, and improve the right relief mechanism of patients' right to know."}, "authors": [{"id": "2404607333", "name": "Ruixuan Liang"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Using a Population–Concept–Context frame and PRISMA-ScR procedures, we mapped peer-reviewed, English-language empirical studies in higher education from 2024 to Q2 2025. A total of 25 studies met criteria. Findings were synthesized via convergent integration that paired quantitative distributions with qualitative themes. Across populations and contexts, GenAI was most often used as assistive scaffolding from planning through revision. Reported benefits clustered around organization, fluency, efficiency, and language support, especially for multilingual writers. Recurrent risks included hallucinations and fabricated citations, inconsistent disclosure or attribution, overreliance when use was unscaffolded, and the limited reliability of AI-detection tools for integrity judgments. Context mattered: clearer policies and better access supported more constructive use. The evidence base skews toward English-medium, well-resourced institutions and relies heavily on short-term or proxy outcomes. Gaps include faculty and postgraduate cohorts and Global South contexts. Overall, the pattern supports an assistive, not substitutive stance: GenAI complements rather than replaces human judgment in argument construction, source interrogation, and synthesis."}, "authors": [{"id": "2185677073", "name": "R.

This research employed a quantitative approach to develop an overall conceptual model that encompasses both the technical and behavioral aspects of intelligent system adoption. The target population consisted of customs officers, border security personnel, and IT personnel responsible for customs clearance and trade facilitation in Jordan. The structured questionnaires were administered to the respondents to measure their perceptions of system effectiveness, satisfaction, performance outcomes, and evasion behavior and yielded a total of 358 valid responses. The research was conducted with proper statistical analysis, and the statistical techniques employed included primary data collected via SPSS Version 29 and advanced modeling using Structural Equation Modeling-Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS) through the use of SmartPLS 4.0. The results indicated that the measurement model proved to be both valid and reliable, with Cronbach's alpha values exceeding 0.82 and AVE values above 0.50, indicating good internal consistency and convergent validity. Moreover, the structural model achieved good explanatory power, with R² values of 59% for Customs Evasion, 43% for User Satisfaction, and 100% for Digital Performance Indicators. These findings underscore the significance of user satisfaction as a key outcome of system effectiveness and a valuable tool for enhancing performance and deterrence. More specifically, the results shown how Intelligent System Effectiveness presents a positive and significant impact on User Satisfaction (β = 0.656, p < 0.001), which in turn has a high positive effect on both Digital Performance Indicators (β = 1.000, p < 0.001) and Customs Evasion reduction (β = 0.770, p < 0.001). The mediation analysis also confirmed that User Satisfaction fully mediates the relationship between system effectiveness and performance outcome, as well as between system effectiveness and evasion reduction. This research contributes to theory and practice by demystifying the design and implementation of AI-driven customs systems. It illustrates the importance of valuing both technical system quality and user-centric values in achieving and maintaining optimal performance in the digital space, as well as conformance with the law."}, "authors": [{"id": "2345486156", "name": "A.

Specific Background: In algorithm and programming domains, Generative AI models frequently assign Higher Order Thinking Skills and Lower Order Thinking Skills labels automatically, creating potential discrepancies with Bloom’s Taxonomy classifications. Knowledge Gap: Empirical evidence validating the reliability of AI-generated cognitive labels and comparing statistical and transformer-based classification methods on small, domain-specific Indonesian datasets remains limited. Aims: This study aims to audit the reliability of cognitive labels generated by the Gemini model through expert validation and to compare TF-IDF–SVM and IndoBERT–SVM classifiers under class-imbalanced conditions. Results: Expert validation revealed substantial mislabeling, with a claimed balanced dataset becoming skewed toward LOTS. Classification experiments using five-fold cross-validation showed that TF-IDF–SVM achieved a slightly higher macro F1-score than IndoBERT–SVM. Novelty: The study demonstrates that simple lexical representations with stemming can outperform transformer-based embeddings when data are limited and domain-specific. Implications: These findings emphasize the necessity of human validation in AI-generated assessments and support the use of lightweight statistical text classification for automated cognitive level evaluation in constrained educational contexts.\nHighlights\n• Generative AI cognitive labels showed substantial inconsistency after expert validation• Lexical feature representation yielded higher macro-level classification balance• Human-in-the-loop validation remained essential for programming assessment datasets\nKeywords\nHOTS; LOTS; Generative AI; Text Classification; TF-IDF"}, "authors": [{"id": "2404794119", "name": "Raissa Araminta Khairunnisa"}, {"id": "35861074", "name": "U.

This empirical research is based on the practical experience of the world’s top 20 countries in AI development in 2020 and 2024, as reflected in the socio-economic statistics of these nations. As a result, the authors developed an econometric model of AI’s impact on the digital society in Russia and other leading AI countries. Drawing on this model, the primary conclusion is that the key specific conditions for the diffusion of AI, which, in turn, shape the development of a digital society in Russia, are the innovativeness of AI technologies, social adaptation to AI, and the accessibility and reliability of AI infrastructure. The scientific novelty and theoretical contribution of this research lie in clarifying the social consequences of modernizing economic systems based on AI. The comparative and trend analysis reveals that Russia’s AI exhibits high global competitiveness (with Russia ranking among the world leaders in overall terms and specific conditions for AI diffusion during 2020–2024), as well as favorable trends in AI (five-year trends indicating improvements in overall and specific conditions for AI diffusion), which encourage further development of the digital society in Russia. The research outlines the prospects for developing a digital society in Russia under the influence of AI through two alternative scenarios – one envisioning the evolution of the digital society in Russia and the other suggesting enhanced inclusiveness, thus highlighting the alternative nature of these digital society characteristics."}, "authors": [{"id": "2404748660", "name": "Konstantin Vodenko"}, {"id": "2404752936", "name": "Platon A.

Standard weight-based dosing may result in either subtherapeutic exposure or toxicity. Machine learning (ML) models can capture complex relationships among clinical variables and support individualized therapy.\n \n \n \n \n We analyzed clinical and pharmacokinetic data from 20 pediatric patients enrolled in the PUERI study (January 2020–November 2021, ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda, Milan, Italy). Eight ML models-including linear regression (LR), ridge regression (RR), lasso regression (LaR), Huber regression (HR), random forest (RF), XGBoost, LightGBM, and a neural network (MLP)-were trained to predict ceftaroline doses that would achieve plasma concentrations close to the therapeutic target of 10 mg/L. Model performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and the coefficient of determination (R\n 2\n ). To ensure interpretability, we applied local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) to identify the most influential predictors of dose.\n \n \n \n \n \n MLP (MAE 1.53 mg, R\n 2\n 0.94) and XGBoost (MAE 2.04 mg, R\n 2\n 0.89) outperformed linear models. Predicted doses were more frequently aligned with therapeutic concentrations than those clinically administered. Model-based simulated concentrations fell within the therapeutic range in approximately 85% of cases, and the best ML models showed over 90% patient-level clinical. RF, LightGBM and XGBoost achieved the highest clinical alignment, with 94.2, 92.4 and 91.5% of patients reaching therapeutic levels. Renal function markers, such as serum creatinine and azotemia, together with anthropometric parameters including weight, height, and body mass index, were consistently the most influential features.\n \n \n \n \n Advanced ML models can optimize ceftaroline dosing in pediatric patients and outperform traditional dosing strategies. Combining predictive accuracy with interpretability (via LIME) supports clinical trust and may enhance precision antibiotic therapy while reducing the risks of antimicrobial resistance and toxicity.\n"}, "authors": [{"id": "2277215513", "name": "Maria Frasca"}, {"id": "2112802466", "name": "Gianluca Gazzaniga"}, {"id": "2355891841", "name": "Agnese Graziosi"}, {"id": "2313853916", "name": "Valentina De Nicolò"}, {"id": "2169391728", "name": "Costantino De Giacomo"}, {"id": "2238651456", "name": "S.

Penggunaan AI dalam transaksi dagang semakin meluas dan kompleks, namun pengaturannya dalam sistem hukum nasional masih belum memadai. Untuk menjawab persoalan tersebut, penelitian ini menggunakan metode yuridis normatif dengan pendekatan konseptual dan komparatif. Data dikumpulkan melalui studi kepustakaan terhadap bahan hukum primer seperti Kitab Undang-Undang Hukum Dagang, Kitab Undang-Undang Hukum Perdata, Undang-Undang Informasi dan Transaksi Elektronik (UU No. 11 Tahun 2008), Undang-Undang Perlindungan Konsumen (UU No. 8 Tahun 1999), serta Peraturan Pemerintah No. 71 Tahun 2019 tentang Penyelenggaraan Sistem dan Transaksi Elektronik, disertai bahan hukum sekunder yang relevan. Analisis dilakukan secara kualitatif untuk menafsirkan norma yang berlaku dan mengidentifikasi kekosongan maupun kelemahan regulasi dalam konteks perdagangan digital berbasis Artificial Intelligence. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa hukum dagang Indonesia belum mengatur secara eksplisit kedudukan, kapasitas hukum, dan tanggung jawab sistem kecerdasan buatan dalam aktivitas dagang, sehingga menimbulkan potensi ketidakpastian dan sengketa bagi para pelaku usaha maupun konsumen. Temuan ini menegaskan perlunya reformasi hukum yang bersifat adaptif dan prospektif melalui pembentukan kerangka hukum komprehensif yang mampu mengakomodasi karakteristik teknologi digital sekaligus memberikan perlindungan hukum, kepastian, serta keadilan dalam praktik perdagangan modern."}, "authors": [{"id": "2406594051", "name": "Fransesko Mahesa Vagansa"}, {"id": "2406595544", "name": "Angelina Pancawati"}, {"id": "2406595103", "name": "Dita Fadzillaturrachman"}, {"id": "2406513125", "name": "Bagas Wisnu Nugroho"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Significance Understanding microbial growth and morphology at the single-cell level is essential for studying microbial physiology, providing valuable insights for research and biotechnology. However, existing workflows often rely on manual cell annotation, which limits efficiency and scalability. Therefore, developing an automated workflow for quantitative analysis of cell growth and morphology is highly desirable. Aim We aim to develop an AI-driven analysis system that efficiently segments and indexes microbial cells, and quantitatively analyzes individual cellular features without requiring expensive annotations, for automated monitoring of cell counts and morphological characteristics. Approach The automated system consists of four modular components: denoising, zero-shot segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM), structured post-processing, and a quantitative feature extraction. To evaluate the effectiveness of each component, we conducted ablation experiments and systematically studied their impact on the overall system performance. Results Denoising and post-processing improved segmentation accuracy by 12.10% and 2.30%, respectively. Among the evaluated SAM variants, the SAM-H model achieved the best performance, with an average error rate of only 3.0% across 1162 manually annotated Escherichia coli cells. Using the optimized SAM-H pipeline, the system efficiently extracted morphometric and intensity features from Escherichia coli cells and nuclei of the yeast and cancer cell lines. Conclusions This framework automates quantitative analysis of microbial cells in high-resolution microscopy images. It will enable advanced research on microbial adaptations, with the potential to accelerate studies of extremophiles under harsh environments."}, "authors": [{"id": null, "name": "Shuang Zhang"}, {"id": "2358455813", "name": "Carleton Coffin"}, {"id": "2240191045", "name": "Karyn L.

These challenges include evaluation criteria being too one-dimensional, over-emphasis on quantitative research, inadequate monitoring and feedback. This paper develops the author’s previous research on teacher performance evaluation reforms at the undergraduate level in Anhui Province. This paper attempts to identify ways AI can be used in teacher performance evaluation to support and facilitate the improvement of strategic, evaluative, and developmental alignment and performance evaluation reforms.\nMethodology/approach: The study relies on a mixed-methods approach rooted in the theories of strategic human resource management. First, a systematic review of the literature, both domestic and global, on teacher performance evaluations, AI in educational management, and strategic human resource management. Second, an AI performance evaluation model is created by adapting an existing strategy-oriented performance evaluation framework for undergraduate educators in Anhui Province and incorporating data analytics, intelligent performance evaluation, and multi-source performance evaluation systems. The evaluation of the proposed model relies on empirical data collected using teacher questionnaires from some undergraduate institutions in Anhui Province, utilizing various statistical techniques such as reliability and validity analyses and structural equation modeling.\nOriginality/Relevance: Use of smart data analysis and multi-faceted assessment tools mitigate the overemphasis on research output metrics and encourage a more holistic and equitable recognition of teaching, research, and community service contributions. Employees experience greater feelings of equity and motivation to perform under the AI evaluative structure. This research examines the evaluation of university faculty using artificial intelligence as a strategic resource management tool in the higher education system. The study responds to a national policy requirement to eliminate the ‘five-only’ framework of evaluation and the current evaluations in undergraduate colleges in Anhui Province, which are described as evaluative, disappointing to teachers, and lacking feedback. Teacher evaluation with AI shows promise in improving objectivity, accuracy, and a developmental focus in evaluation.\n \nKey findings: The findings indicate that AI can close the gap between the university’s strategic goals and the individual aims of the faculty, enhance the accuracy and justifiability of evaluation criteria, and strengthen evaluation criteria and systems for feedback and sustained improvement.\n \nTheoretical/methodological contributions: The integration of artificial intelligence and the theories of strategic human resource management and performance evaluation gives rise to a new theory in the management of higher education. The new theory is the foundation of the construction of a systematic AI evaluative structure, which is a valuable and unique contribution of this work. The systematic AI evaluative structure, which is based on the principles of goal management, competence-driven evaluative criteria, and intelligent feedback systems, is an empirically proven model for transformative reform of the evaluative frameworks of teacher performance in higher education, especially in institutions in Anhui Province."}, "authors": [{"id": "2406582586", "name": "Song Jiao"}, {"id": "13843372", "name": "Sururi Sururi"}, {"id": "2406580549", "name": "Aan Komariah"}, {"id": "66414798", "name": "T.

COVID-19\npandemisi bu durumu daha da ağırlaştırarak, dijital çözümlere ve yeni müdahale yöntemlerine olan ihtiyacı artırmıştır. Bu bağlamda yapay zekâ, psikiyatri\nve psikoterapide önemli bir dönüşüm potansiyeli sunmaktadır. Yapay zekâ; alt teknolojiler aracılığıyla tanı, prognoz, tedavi ve psiko-eğitim süreçlerinde\ngiderek daha yaygın kullanılmaktadır. Klinik karar destek sistemleri, doğal dil işleme tabanlı duygu analizi, mobil uygulamalar ve telepsikiyatri çözümleri,\nsağlık profesyonellerine iş yükünü hafifletme ve hizmet erişimini artırmada güçlü imkânlar sunmaktadır. Duygudurum bozukluklarında elektroensefalografi\ntabanlı derin öğrenme modelleri tanıda yüksek doğruluk sağlamış; sanal terapi araçları ise psiko-eğitim ve semptom azaltmada anlamlı etkiler göstermiştir.\nŞizofreni, bipolar bozukluk ve otizmde kullanılan algoritmalar, hastalık seyri tahmininde ve erken tanıda umut verici sonuçlar vermektedir. Bununla birlikte,\nveri gizliliği, etik sorunlar ve klinik doğrulama ihtiyacı, bu teknolojilerin yaygınlaşmasının önündeki başlıca engellerdir. Yapay zekâ ruh sağlığı alanında büyük\nfırsatlar sunsa da etik riskler ve insan-insan etkileşiminin azalması nedeniyle ancak insan merkezli, şeffaf ve tarafsız bir şekilde uygulandığında etkili\nolabilir. Sonuç olarak, yapay zekânın psikiyatrideki rolü hızla genişlemekte olup, gelecekte daha erişilebilir, maliyet-etkin ve kişiselleştirilmiş ruh sağlığı\nhizmetleri sunulmasına katkı sağlayacağı öngörülmektedir. Bu süreçte etik ilkelerin, hasta mahremiyetinin ve insan merkezli yaklaşımların korunması kritik\nönemdedir.\nAnahtar Kelimeler: Yapay Zekâ, Öğrenme, Ruhsal Bozukluklar, Etik"}, "authors": [{"id": "2306508098", "name": "Hasan Belli"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Access to high-quality board preparation resources is uneven and often cost-prohibitive, disproportionately affecting students from underrepresented or financially disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\n\nAPPROACH\nAn AI-driven system to generate USMLE-style practice questions aligned with NBME item-writing guidelines using a Large Language Model (LLM) enhanced with retrieval augmented generation (RAG), chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting, and JSON schema validation was developed and piloted at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine between November and December 2023. Five lectures from a preclinical hematology course were selected, and 565 questions were generated for 177 first-year medical students. A human-in-the-loop process, led by a faculty course director, ensured content validity and adherence to educational standards. Validated questions were deployed via a mobile app, allowing students to practice, receive performance feedback, and access an AI tutor.\n\n\nOUTCOMES\nOf the 565 questions, 490 (87%) were deemed accurate and NBME-compliant. Eighty students used the question bank, completing up to 220 questions each. Although not statistically significant, increased use trended toward improved performance on related exam questions. Qualitative feedback highlighted enthusiasm for AI-assisted study tools, with calls for broader content coverage.\n\n\nNEXT STEPS\nThis pilot demonstrates that LLMs can generate high-quality, guideline-aligned practice questions. To improve scalability and reduce faculty workload, future iterations will incorporate AI-based review agents for pre-screening content. The platform is intended to be expanded to additional courses, training phases, and health professions. Ongoing refinement will focus on improving content specificity and maintaining accuracy, especially in advanced and subspecialty education."}, "authors": [{"id": "2375794397", "name": "Andrew Zahn"}, {"id": "2267182282", "name": "Seth Overla"}, {"id": "2406791047", "name": "D.

Applying information design methods from Strack and Yang (2024), this paper provides decision problem agnostic conditions under which separation training preference free and applying preferences ex post is optimal. Unlike prior work that requires specifying downstream objectives, the welfare results here apply uniformly across decision problems. The key primitive is a diminishing-value-of-information condition: relative to a fixed (normalised) preference-free loss, preference embedding makes informativeness less valuable at the margin, inducing a mean-preserving contraction of learned posteriors. Because the value of information is convex in beliefs, preference-free training weakly dominates for any expected utility decision problem. This provides theoretical foundations for modular AI pipelines that learn calibrated probabilities and implement asymmetric costs through downstream decision rules. However, separation requires users to implement optimal decision rules. When cognitive constraints bind, as documented in human AI decision-making, preference embedding can dominate by automating threshold computation. These results provide design guidance: preserve optionality through post-processing when objectives may shift; embed preferences when decision-stage frictions dominate."}, "authors": [{"id": "2362107267", "name": "Joshua S.

At present, most artificial intelligence systems are still categorized as narrow AI, capable of performing only specific and well-defined tasks. To move toward more general intelligence, a promising approach is through collective collaboration among multiple narrow AIs. However, the uncontrolled growth of such systems could pose significant risks in the future. To mitigate these risks, we propose the implementation of an artificial prefrontal cortex mechanism within the collaborative framework of narrow AIs. This mechanism functions as both a safety controller and a task switcher, determining which narrow AI should be activated for a given context. Through this architecture, the collaborative system may evolve toward adaptive and safe general intelligence, which is capable of coordination and reasoning, yet constrained by ethical and operational safeguards."}, "authors": [{"id": "2405697076", "name": "Rachmad Imam Tarecha"}, {"id": "2337130719", "name": "Priska Choirina"}, {"id": "2405697096", "name": "Urnika Mudhifatul Jannah"}, {"id": "2405698006", "name": "Bagus Seta Inba Cipta"}, {"id": "2405698203", "name": "Pangestuti Prima Darajat"}, {"id": "2405698041", "name": "Amalia Agung Septarina"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Its applications extend across diagnosis, planning, intraoperative assistance, postoperative monitoring, rehabilitation, prosthetics and education.\n\n\nAPPLICATIONS\nIn diagnostic imaging, AI improves the detection of distal radius and scaphoid fractures, estimates osteoporosis from hand radiographs, identifies triangular fibrocartilage complex injuries on magnetic resonance imaging, segments bones and cartilage, and supports dynamic wrist analysis; ultrasound- and neurophysiological-based models aid carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosis. Prognostic models predict outcomes after carpal tunnel release and thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis with mixed performance. Pre- and intraoperative applications include large language model-based triage and coding, navigation and phase/gesture recognition from surgical video, autonomous microsurgical prototypes and telemanipulator platforms for supermicrosurgery. Artificial intelligence-enabled telemonitoring (e.g. remote photoplethysmography) and video-based mobility tracking support postoperative care and rehabilitation. Vision-guided and multimodal sensing enhance myoelectric prosthesis control.\n\n\nRISKS\nRisks include data privacy and security, algorithmic bias (data, transposition, normative, annotation) and opacity, overreliance with automation bias and skill erosion, and unresolved legal and ethical questions (liability, conflicts of interest, compassion in care).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBalanced adoption requires diversified datasets, privacy-preserving strategies (pseudonymization, differential privacy, federated learning), transparent reporting, AI literacy and ethics in medical education and interfaces that expose uncertainty and employ cognitive forcing functions.

These gains, however, are increasingly accompanied by concerns regarding long-horizon developmental behavior, as many systems converge toward repetitive solution patterns rather than sustained growth. We argue that a central limitation of contemporary AI systems lies not in capability per se, but in the premature fixation of their performance frontier. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of a \\emph{Dynamic Intelligence Ceiling} (DIC), defined as the highest level of effective intelligence attainable by a system at a given time under its current resources, internal intent, and structural configuration. To make this notion empirically tractable, we propose a trajectory-centric evaluation framework that measures intelligence as a moving frontier rather than a static snapshot. We operationalize DIC using two estimators: the \\emph{Progressive Difficulty Ceiling} (PDC), which captures the maximal reliably solvable difficulty under constrained resources, and the \\emph{Ceiling Drift Rate} (CDR), which quantifies the temporal evolution of this frontier. These estimators are instantiated through a procedurally generated benchmark that jointly evaluates long-horizon planning and structural creativity within a single controlled environment. Our results reveal a qualitative distinction between systems that deepen exploitation within a fixed solution manifold and those that sustain frontier expansion over time. Importantly, our framework does not posit unbounded intelligence, but reframes limits as dynamic and trajectory-dependent rather than static and prematurely fixed. \\vspace{0.5em} \\noindent\\textbf{Keywords:} AI evaluation, planning and creativity, developmental intelligence, dynamic intelligence ceilings, complex adaptive systems"}, "authors": [{"id": "2398808711", "name": "Truong Xuan Khanh"}, {"id": "2398810516", "name": "Truong Quynh Hoa"}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science"]}

We call this phenomenon Artificial Jagged Intelligence (AJI). This paper develops a tractable economic model of AJI that treats adoption as an information problem: users care about \\emph{local} reliability, but typically observe only coarse, global quality signals. In a baseline one-dimensional landscape, truth is a rough Brownian process, and the model ``knows''scattered points drawn from a Poisson process. The model interpolates optimally, and the local error is measured by posterior variance. We derive an adoption threshold for a blind user, show that experienced errors are amplified by the inspection paradox, and interpret scaling laws as denser coverage that improves average quality without eliminating jaggedness. We then study mastery and calibration: a calibrated user who can condition on local uncertainty enjoys positive expected value even in domains that fail the blind adoption test. Modelling mastery as learning a reliability map via Gaussian process regression yields a learning-rate bound driven by information gain, clarifying when discovering ``where the model works''is slow. Finally, we study how scaling interacts with discoverability: when calibrated signals and user mastery accelerate the harvesting of scale improvements, and when opacity can make gains from scaling effectively invisible."}, "authors": [{"id": "2270755268", "name": "Joshua Gans"}], "fields_of_study": ["Economics", "Computer Science"]}

The Machine Perturbational Complexity & Agency Battery (mPCAB) introduces a new, substrate-independent framework that applies neurophysiological methods used initially to assess consciousness in artificial systems. Unlike existing evaluations, it features four key components—perturbational complexity, global workspace assessment, norm internalization, and agency—that link mechanisms with functions. This enables systematic comparisons across digital, neuromorphic, and biological substrates, addressing three research gaps: long-term reasoning with coherent behavior, norm internalization amid distribution shifts, and transformational creativity involving meta-cognitive rule modification. By analyzing theories of consciousness (GNW, IIT, PP, HOT), we identify targets for AI implementation. Our cognitive architecture analysis maps human functions—such as working memory and executive control—to their computational counterparts, providing guiding principles for design. The creativity taxonomy progresses from combinational to transformational, with measurable criteria like changes in conceptual space and the depth of meta-level reasoning. Ethical considerations are integrated into frameworks for monitoring organoid intelligence, reducing bias in creativity, and addressing rights issues. Pilot studies demonstrate mPCAB’s feasibility across different substrates and show that its metrics are comparable. This framework moves evaluation away from superficial benchmarks toward mechanism-based assessment, supporting the development of mind-like machines and responsible AI advancements."}, "authors": [{"id": "152158686", "name": "Sarfaraz K.

However, their transformative potential is hindered by immense computational resources required. To address this challenge, the integration of LLMs with edge-cloud computing has become a focal point in advancing the capabilities of artificial intelligence. This survey comprehensively exploits the landscape of edge-enhanced intelligence, specifically focusing on the synergy between LLMs and edge-cloud computing. We delve into the evolution of LLMs, architectural intricacies, and the computational challenges associated with deploying them in edge environments from the aspects of data, computing power, model training and inference. Furthermore, we exploit the bidirectional symbiotic relationship between edge-cloud computing and LLMs from two key aspects: edge-cloud computing empowered LLMs (Edge4LLMs) and LLMs driven edge-cloud computing (LLMs4Edge).

While LLMs have significantly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), they face challenges in reasoning, adaptability, and bias. AGI, with its human-like cognitive functions, offers a promising solution by enhancing the flexibility and context-awareness of LLMs. This paper explores the integration of AGI with LLMs to address complex, dynamic problems, focusing on advancements in Cognitive Radio (CR) and Spectrum Intelligence (SI) technologies. Spectrum sensing, a cornerstone of CR and SI, is critical for identifying underutilized frequency bands and mitigating interference. Traditional methods often struggle in dynamic environments due to their reliance on static models. By combining AGI’s adaptive decision-making with LLMs’ context-aware understanding, the integrated system can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of spectrum sensing. This integration enables better processing of diverse data, prediction of spectrum usage, and dynamic adaptation to changing conditions, paving the way for intelligent spectrum management. As the demand for efficient communication grows with the proliferation of connected devices, AGI-augmented LLMs offer scalable, context-aware solutions to modern communication challenges. AGI with LLMs has the potential to transform spectrum sensing and management into a more adaptive, efficient paradigm, ensuring the performance of next-generation wireless networks."}, "authors": [{"id": "35569938", "name": "Shumaila Javaid"}, {"id": "2379298635", "name": "Naveed Khan"}, {"id": "3360346", "name": "Abdulmalik Alwarafy"}, {"id": "2299941685", "name": "Nasir Saeed"}], "fields_of_study": null}

In response, this study analyzed the perceptions of first-year preservice teachers at the Centro de Actualización del Magisterio of Durango, Mexico, regarding the use and acceptance of Artificial Intelligence in their academic training, using the Technology Acceptance Model proposed by Zhai et al. (2024). The study was conducted within the positivist paradigm, with a quantitative approach and an exploratory cross-sectional design. A 27-item questionnaire, comprising five dimensions, was administered to 55 students enrolled in the Bachelor’s programs in Primary and Preschool Education. The results revealed a high willingness toward Artificial Intelligence, particularly in the dimensions of Behavioral Intention and Perceived Usefulness, while Anxiety and Self-efficacy showed low and dispersed ratings. Reliability yielded robust coefficients (Cronbach’s alpha = .918; McDonald’s omega = .951). The Friedman test was significant (p < 0.05), and post hoc analysis using the Wilcoxon test confirmed differences in eight dimension pairings, except for Self-efficacy–Perceived Usefulness (p = .145) and Behavioral Intention–Perceived Ease of Use (p = .112).

Firstly, research in sensing should extend how AI captures the world in richer ways beyond the digital medium. Secondly, developing a principled science for quantifying multimodal heterogeneity and interactions, developing unified modeling architectures and representations, and understanding cross-modal transfer.

With the rapid development of AI technology in recent years, how to compare and evaluate human and AI intelligence has become an important theoretical issue. However, existing definitions of intelligence are anthropocentric and unsuitable for empirical comparison, resulting in a lack of consensus in the research field. This paper first introduces four criteria for evaluating intelligence definitions based on R. Carnap's methodology of conceptual clarification: similarity to explicandum, exactness, fruitfulness, and simplicity. We then examine six representative definitions: IQ testing, complex problem-solving ability, reward optimization, environmental adaptation, learning efficiency, and predictive ability, and clarify their theoretical strengths and limitations. The results show that while definitions based on predictive ability have high explanatory power and empirical feasibility, they suffer from an inability to adequately explain the relationship between predictions and behavior/benefits. This paper proposes the Extended Predictive Hypothesis (EPH), which views intelligence as a combination of the ability to accurately predict the future and the ability to benefit from those predictions. Furthermore, by distinguishing predictive ability into spontaneous and reactive predictions and adding the concept of gainability, we present a unified framework for explaining various aspects of intelligence, such as creativity, learning, and future planning. In conclusion, this paper argues that the EPH is the most satisfactory and universal definition for comparing human and AI intelligence."}, "authors": [{"id": "2404011454", "name": "Joseph Chen"}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science"]}

Open issues include where should we read from in ANNs to check behavior? What should be the read-out? Is this ad-hoc read-out considered part of the brain model or not? In order to understand vision-ANNs, should we use artificial psychophysics or artificial physiology? Anyhow, should artificial tests literally match the experiments done with humans? These questions suggest a clear need for biologically sensible tests for deep models of the visual brain, and more generally, to understand ANNs devoted to generic vision tasks. Following our use of low-level facts from Vision Science in Image Processing, we present a low-level dataset compiling the basic spatio-chromatic properties that describe the adaptive bottleneck of the retina-V1 pathway and are not currently available in popular databases such as BrainScore. We propose its use for qualitative and quantitative model evaluation. As an illustration of the proposed methods, we check the behavior of three recent models with similar deep architectures: (1) A parametric model tuned via the psychophysical method of Maximum Differentiation [Malo & Simoncelli SPIE 15, Martinez et al.

This paper synthesizes AI-enabled big data analytics for precision medicine, drawing on evidence from cancer diagnostics, prediction of chronic diseases, genomics-based drug discovery, and explainable clinical intelligence.

The framework focuses on ethical data governance and scalable analytics pipelines, and clinician-centric transparency to bridge the gap between algorithmic innovation and real-world healthcare implementation. Synthesized results of findings show the consistent superiority of certain AI-relying big data analytics over traditional methods for disease classification, risk stratification, and therapeutic decision support and for certain other new challenges concerning model explainability, data privacy, and healthcare equity (Rahman et al., 2025; Samiun et al., 2025).

However, ensuring users’ quality of experience (QoE) under resource-constrained conditions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce a cross-modal semantic communication transmission scheme for mobile-AIGPV. This scheme generates low-resolution panoramic videos on the edge server and transmits them via cross-modal semantic communication. Furthermore, to better ensure users’ QoE, we propose a panoramic video super-resolution transmission framework based on deep joint source-channel coding (JSCC), named PVSR-JSCC. This framework leverages neural networks (NNs) and attention mechanisms to achieve semantic extraction and adaptive variable-length coding, and performs feature cyclic enhancement based on the motion and context, thereby achieving the panoramic video super-resolution task. Additionally, we design a cross-modal swin transformer block (CMSTB) to enhance the deep JSCC performance. The CMSTB integrates self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms, enabling deep JSCC to capture the intrinsic semantic correlation between text and video. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to the semantic communication scheme directly transmitting high-resolution videos, our proposed PVSR-JSCC not only reduces bandwidth consumption by 36.7% but also lowers computational complexity of the semantic model by 42.8%. Moreover, it effectively prevents the “cliff effect” caused by the decrease of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in traditional communication systems."}, "authors": [{"id": "2287814907", "name": "Haixiao Gao"}, {"id": "11564157", "name": "Mengying Sun"}, {"id": "2124728498", "name": "Xiaodong Xu"}, {"id": "2322991794", "name": "Xiqi Cheng"}, {"id": "67146483", "name": "Shujun Han"}, {"id": "2237389621", "name": "Ping Zhang"}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science"]}

Namely, the incorporation of such systems will engender subtle but significant changes to the state’s deliberative and organisational structures, its culture, and its capacities – and in ways that could undermine its adherence to international norms of restraint. In offering this provocation, we argue that the gradual proliferation and embeddedness of AI-enabled decision-support systems within the state – what we call the ‘phenomenon of “Borgs in the org”’ – will lead to four significant changes that, together, threaten to diminish the state’s crucial capacity for ‘institutional learning’. Specifically, the state’s reliance on AI-enabled decision-support systems in deliberations over war initiation will invite: (i) disrupted deliberative structures and chains of command; (ii) the occlusion of crucial steps in decision-making processes; (iii) institutionalised deference to computer-generated outputs; and (iv) future plans and trajectories that are overdetermined by past policies and actions. The resulting ‘institutional atrophy’ could, in turn, weaken the state’s responsiveness to external social cues and censure, thereby making the state less likely to engage with, internalise, and adhere to evolving international norms of restraint.

Despite their remarkable capabilities in generating content, these models encounter substantial challenges when producing structured outputs and engaging in dynamic interactions, particularly when they need to retrieve external information in real time. To address these limitations, researchers have developed the ”Function Calling” paradigm. This approach enables language models to analyze user inquiries and engage with defined functions, thereby facilitating precise responses through connections to external sources, including databases, programming interfaces, and live data streams. This functionality has been successfully implemented across numerous sectors such as finance analytics, healthcare systems, and service operations. The implementation of function calling comprises three essential phases: preparation, execution, and processing. The preparation phase encompasses query analysis and function identification. During execution, the system evaluates whether a function is necessary, extracts relevant parameters, and oversees the operation. The processing phase concentrates on analyzing outcomes and crafting appropriate responses. Each phase presents unique difficulties, ranging from accurately selecting functions to managing complex parameter extraction and ensuring reliable execution. Researchers have established various evaluation frameworks and metrics to assess function calling performance, including success rates, computational efficiency, parameter extraction accuracy, and response quality indicators such as ROUGE-L evaluation scores. This survey systematically reviews the current landscape of function calling in LLMs, analyzing technical challenges, examining existing solutions, and discussing evaluation methodologies. We particularly focus on practical implementations and industrial applications, providing insights into both current achievements and future directions in this rapidly evolving field.

To this end, this paper presents a Deterministic Communication, Computation, and Control (Det3C) integration network architecture, which is composed of four layers, i.e., end, edge, core, and cloud layers. Specifically, the distributed ICPS domains of end layers are responsible for local training of AIGC models. The updated model parameters are aggregated in edge severs and then transmitted to a cloud sever for global aggregation through wide-area core networks. Besides, we adopt a cyclic queuing and forwarding (CQF) mechanism and design an enhanced cycle specified queuing and forwarding (E-CSQF) mechanism to ensure the deterministic transmission of parameter flows. To obtain optimal ICPS domain selection and computing and temporal (i.e., queue) resource allocation decisions for flow processing and transmission, we formulate a joint optimization problem with the objective to minimize the overall delay of AIGC models. Due to complicated coupled constraints among decisions, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based cross-domain computing orchestration scheme is proposed to reduce computing delay and a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based deterministic flow scheduling scheme is designed to optimize transmission delay while improving scheduling success ratio.

Despite significant advancements, FL-based modulation decoding faces two primary challenges: (1) Vulnerability to noisy environments - Current studies often prioritize high-quality datasets during training to ensure model performance, which often results in overfitting since real-world signals involve a wide range of noise levels from various sources. (2) Model divergence in non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) environments - The aggregation step in a conventional FL leads to divergence on a large federated scale, resulting in the loss of local-specific knowledge. Moreover, existing FL-based modulation decoding studies typically focus on a single non-IID issue, which limits their ability to generalize across large-scale heterogeneous settings. To address these challenges, we propose FedVaccine, a framework that enhances model generalization across diverse noise conditions and non-IID data environments. Instead of relying on high-quality datasets that risk overfitting, FedVaccine employs a harmonic noise resilience approach—akin to a vaccination effect—that deliberately exposes the model to controlled noise, identifying noise tolerance, regularizing training, and ensuring robust decoding performance across varying noise levels. Additionally, FedVaccine incorporates a Federated Split Learning approach to cumulatively update the global model, ensuring adaptive recalibration and mitigating the loss of local knowledge during aggregation. Furthermore, a localized support set is used to ensure effective personalization. Experimental results demonstrate that FedVaccine outperforms existing FL-based modulation classification models and other learning paradigms in both IID and non-IID scenarios using public datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in practical deployment scenarios across wireless networks."}, "authors": [{"id": "2298212072", "name": "Hunmin Lee"}, {"id": "2326111807", "name": "Hongju Seong"}, {"id": "2298205990", "name": "Jihun Bae"}, {"id": "2326351919", "name": "Wonbin Kim"}, {"id": "2327731618", "name": "Hyeokchan Kwon"}, {"id": "2347180678", "name": "Youngsoo Kim"}, {"id": "2326114596", "name": "Daehee Seo"}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science"]}

One viable solution involves partitioning DNN tasks into multiple subtasks and distributing them across multiple satellites for collaborative computing. Despite its potential, it faces challenges in effectively partitioning DNNs to minimize delay and energy consumption while ensuring efficient subtask allocation to maintain load balancing and high task completion rates. To this end, we propose an adaptive DNN partitioning and task offloading framework named APT-SAT to enable efficient distributed computing among multiple satellites.

However, to facilitate specialized generative edge intelligence in dynamic UV networks, GAI models need to tap into local data and conduct online fine-tuning, and the dispersed distribution of UVs makes distributed fine-tuning paradigms crucial. Although the federated generative model fine-tuning brings a potential solution, the large number of parameter transmissions involved in its fine-tuning process are often constrained by communication bottlenecks, which are more pronounced for resource-constrained UV networks. To cope with these challenges, we introduce an energy-efficient GAI model fine-tuning framework for the hierarchical UV networks, which employs over-the-air technology to save computational resource costs for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) during federated aggregation within a federated learning paradigm. Thereafter, we study the resource allocation problem in the fine-tuning process of the generative model and formulate a joint optimization problem for the bandwidth allocation, power control, computation resource allocation, and denoising factor control, aiming to minimize the system energy consumption. Then, we decouple the original problem into four tractable subproblems, and propose a block coordinate descent algorithm to solve them iteratively. Particularly, we derive a closed-form solution for the denoising factor to minimize the local model uploading transmission energy consumption under a specific AirComp communication error threshold. Simulation based on the state-of-the-art generative models shows that our AirComp-assisted federated generative model fine-tuning scheme can achieve satisfactory customized field-of-view image generation capability compared with the traditional fine-tuning scheme in an energy-efficient way."}, "authors": [{"id": "2124209688", "name": "Yikun Zhao"}, {"id": "2191441763", "name": "Lei Feng"}, {"id": "2278708", "name": "F.

There is a developing regulatory landscape for this kind of novel technology. Regulatory requirements are expected to be application specific, and may need to be tailored to each specific use case. We draw on emerging guidance for both Digital Twin development and the use of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) in Air Traffic Management (ATM) to present an assurance framework. This framework defines actionable goals and the evidence required to demonstrate that a Digital Twin accurately represents its physical counterpart and also provides sufficient functionality across target use cases. It provides a structured approach for researchers to assess, understand and document the strengths and limitations of the Digital Twin, whilst also identifying areas where fidelity could be improved. Furthermore, it serves as a foundation for engagement with stakeholders and regulators, supporting discussions around the regulatory needs for future applications, and contributing to the emerging guidance through a concrete, working example of a Digital Twin. The framework leverages a methodology known as Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) to develop an assurance case.

The AI-driven framework guarantees optimal power allocation for eﬃcient beamforming by activating the minimal number of grids from the HMIMO base station. An optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sensing utility function, aiming to maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the received signal, beam-pattern gains to improve the sensing SINR of reﬂected echo signals and maximizing the evidence lower bound minus loss function, which in turn minimizes the losses of the ISAC process, and maximizes achievable rate for eﬃcient power allocation. A novel AI-driven framework is presented to tackle the formulated NP-hard problem by decomposing it into two problems: a sensing problem and a power allocation problem. The sensing problem is solved by employing a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based mechanism that obtains the sensing information leveraging AoS, which is used for the location update. Subsequently, a deep deterministic policy gradient-based deep reinforcement learning scheme is devised to allocate the desired power by activating the required grids based on the ﬁndings achieved with the VAE-based mechanism. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed AI framework compared to advantage actor-critic and deep Q-network-based methods, achieving a cumulative average SINR improvement of 8.5 dB and 10.27 dB, and a cumulative average achievable rate improvement of 21.59 bps/Hz and 4.22 bps/Hz, respectively."}, "authors": [{"id": "67343585", "name": "Apurba Adhikary"}, {"id": "2209218438", "name": "Avi Deb Raha"}, {"id": "2209185953", "name": "Yu Qiao"}, {"id": "30950089", "name": "M.

Then, to achieve the efficient learning of GSC models deployed on each user, a Personalized Semantic Federated Learning (PSFL) framework is proposed. Specifically, in the local training phase, a Personalized Local Distillation (PLD) approach is employed, where each user selects a tailored GSC model as a mentor based on local resources. This mentor subsequently distills knowledge to a unified student model, ensuring compliance with the model isomorphism requirements of FL. In the global aggregation phase, an Adaptive Global Pruning (AGP) scheme is applied, dynamically pruning or expanding the aggregated global model based on real-time channel conditions.

Due to the resource constraints of edge networks and the diverse requirements of user tasks, it is critical to design an inference framework that effectively coordinates the deployment and collaboration of LLMs and SLMs. In this paper, we propose an LLM-SLM collaborative inference (LSCI) scheme under a mobile edge computing (MEC) architecture, which jointly decides where to cache models and how to offload inference tasks to balance latency, accuracy, and resource costs. To optimize inference performance subject to resource constraints, we jointly solve the inference task offloading and model caching problem in LSCI scheme. Specifically, we employ deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to select highly popular SLMs to be cached on the edge server, and distributed belief propagation technique to solve the associated inference task offloading issue.

However, existing SFL frameworks would frequently upload smashed data and download gradients between the server and each client, leading to severe communication overheads. To address this issue, this work proposes a novel communication-and-computation efficient SFL framework, which allows dynamic model splitting (server- and client-side model cutting point selection) and broadcasting of aggregated smashed data gradients. We theoretically analyze the impact of the cutting point selection on the convergence rate, revealing that model splitting with a smaller client-side model size leads to a better convergence performance and vise versa. Based on the above insights, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the model convergence rate and latency under the consideration of data privacy via a joint Cutting point selection, Communication and Computation resource allocation (CCC) strategy. To deal with the proposed mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization problem, we develop an algorithm by integrating the Double Deep Q-learning Network (DDQN) with convex optimization methods.

Accurate traffic prediction is crucial for reducing congestion, improving travel efficiency, and enhancing traffic safety. However, the complex and dynamically changing spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic networks make the prediction task highly challenging. Most existing methods rely on self-attention mechanisms to capture these spatio-temporal dependencies, which often result in high computational complexity. Furthermore, although traffic systems can be modeled as graph structures, graph convolutional network (GCN), which effectively capture correlations between nodes, typically depend on predefined or adaptive adjacency matrices. These approaches struggle to cope with the highly dynamic nature of real-world traffic systems. To address these issues, we propose a spatio-temporal mamba dynamic graph convolutional recurrent neural network (STMAGRN). This model first leverages the mamba framework to extract spatio-temporal features from traffic sequences. The mamba model, through its unique selective state space mechanism and linear time complexity, achieves efficient sequence processing. Next, we design a spatio-temporal memory module (STM), which identifies and extracts traffic pattern features most similar to the input data, and learns intrinsic representative traffic patterns from the data associated with each node. These patterns are then used to dynamically generate graph structures, providing GCN with real-time updated graph data. Finally, we combine GCN with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to extract both spatial and temporal features simultaneously. We conducted extensive experiments on six real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that STMAGRN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in traffic prediction tasks."}, "authors": [{"id": "2115795460", "name": "Xiaoyan Zhang"}, {"id": "2333531232", "name": "Yongqin Zhang"}, {"id": "2315479217", "name": "Xiangfu Meng"}], "fields_of_study": null}

In the mask training stage, the multimodal sequence is masked by random zeroing, and global features are extracted through the Transformer encoder. Subsequently, these features are processed by two methods to obtain the prediction sequence and classification probability. Considering the homogeneous uncertainty of the prediction and classification tasks, a joint loss with learnable weights is constructed. In the fine-tuning stage, the unmasked multimodal sequence is taken as input, and the cross-entropy loss with a low learning rate is used to update the model. Simulation results show that MTAMR with a simple backbone structure, achieves significant recognition accuracy on multiple datasets by leveraging mask modeling and multimodal fusion representation, while the computational complexity is feasible."}, "authors": [{"id": "2326532238", "name": "Weisi Kong"}, {"id": "2150444432", "name": "Xun Jiao"}, {"id": "2213641841", "name": "Yuhua Xu"}, {"id": "2238057121", "name": "Qinghai Yang"}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science"]}

In this article, we first demonstrate current networks’ bottlenecks for supporting XR content transmission in the Metaverse. Then, we explore the potential approaches and challenges of utilizing GAI to overcome these bottlenecks. To address these challenges, we propose a GAI-based XR content transmission framework which leverages a cloud-edge collaboration architecture. The cloud servers are responsible for storing and rendering the original XR content, while edge servers utilize GAI models to generate essential parts of XR content (e.g., subsequent frames, selected objects, etc.) when network resources are insufficient to transmit them. A Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based decision module is proposed to solve the decision-making problems.

Rapid response to multiple landslide events demands accurate, all-weather, day-and-night detection capabilities. Optical remote sensing has advanced landslide detection but remains limited under adverse weather and lighting conditions. Synthetic Aperture Radar, resilient to these constraints, remains underexplored for automated landslide detection due to challenges such as complex pre-processing and geometric distortions. This study integrates Deep Neural Networks with Sentinel-1 backscatter data for co-seismic landslide detection, utilizing a data-centric approach. We train and test the models using 11 earthquake-induced widespread landslide events, covering ≈ 73 000 landslides across diverse geologic and climatic settings. Inference on unseen events in Haiti (2021) and Sumatra (2022) demonstrates robust transferability, achieving F1-scores up to 82 %. Using explainable artificial intelligence, we highlight the discriminative capability of change detection bands over backscatter alone.

Sixty-nine translators took part in an in-person experiment, where they assessed three anonymized short stories - two written by ChatGPT-4o and one by a human author. For each story, participants rated the likelihood of AI authorship and provided justifications for their choices. While average results were inconclusive, a statistically significant subset (16.2%) successfully distinguished the synthetic texts from the human text, suggesting that their judgements were informed by analytical skill rather than chance. However, a nearly equal number misclassified the texts in the opposite direction, often relying on subjective impressions rather than objective markers, possibly reflecting a reader preference for AI-generated texts. Low burstiness and narrative contradiction emerged as the most reliable indicators of synthetic authorship, with unexpected calques, semantic loans and syntactic transfer from English also reported.

Legal systems have long been open to extending personhood to non-human entities, most prominently corporations, for instrumental or inherent reasons. Instrumental rationales emphasize accountability and administrative efficiency, whereas inherent ones appeal to moral worth and autonomy. Neither is yet sufficient to justify conferring personhood on AI. Nevertheless, the acceleration of technological autonomy may lead us to reconsider how law conceptualizes agency and responsibility. Drawing on comparative jurisprudence, corporate theory, and the emerging literature on AI governance, the paper argues that existing frameworks can address short-term accountability gaps, but the eventual development of superintelligence may force a paradigmatic shift in our understanding of law itself. In such a speculative future, legal personality may depend less on the cognitive sophistication of machines than on humanity's ability to preserve our own moral and institutional sovereignty."}, "authors": [{"id": "2402898052", "name": "Simon Chesterman"}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science"]}

Wireless large artificial intelligence model (WLAM), as a pivotal technology, leverages deep semantic awareness together with intelligent inference and decision-making capabilities to drive the evolution of applications in artificial intelligent internet of things (AIoT). However, despite the unprecedented efficiency, native intelligence, and seamless connectivity of 6G, deploying WLAM in AIoT environment remains challenging due to limited computational resource of edge terminals, communication bottlenecks from billion-scale parameters, and privacy trade-off. In response, we propose a hierarchical split federated learning framework assisted by edge intelligence of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), called federated learning via aerial splitting hierarchy (FLASH), to help computing offloading of client-side through aerial nodes. The framework jointly optimizes model splitting layers, client-UAV pairing, and computational resource allocation of UAVs. Then, we formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem with objectives of weighted averages of single-round training latency and client energy consumption, subject to UAV energy and computational resource constraints. To solve the complex joint optimization problem, we formalize this problem as a markov decision process (MDP) and design a distributed synchronous deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on proximal policy optimization, achieving efficient joint resource scheduling through parallel training and synchronous policy updates.

From an artificial intelligence perspective, this paper proposes an enhanced multiagent reinforcement learning framework that employs action estimation neural networks to infer agent behaviors. By integrating a lightweight action estimation module, each agent infers neighboring agents'behaviors using only locally observable information, enabling collaborative policy learning without explicit action sharing. This approach is fully compatible with standard TD3 algorithms and scalable to larger multiagent systems. At the engineering application level, this framework has been implemented and validated in dual-arm robotic manipulation tasks: two robotic arms collaboratively lift objects.

Conversational, ChatGPT supports natural interactions, providing human-like responses to queries across myriad topics. But it is not infallible, and the degree of accuracy also depends on the complexity of the queries, the context, and how often the prompts are repeated. This work thus proposes a new model, the Precision Answer Comparison and Evaluation Model (PACEM), to systematically address these types of questions and assess ChatGPT's performance. PACEM assesses the correctness and coherence of ChatGPT's answers across numerous fields, including literature, history, law, ethics, and sports. By providing these analyses and comparisons, PACEM goes on record with a detailed understanding of what ChatGPT does well and poorly as a source of reliable information. On top of that, it includes an assessment of response time, considering ChatGPT's speed in producing answers in relation to real or expected ones. The findings show that ChatGPT's answers are usually substantially accurate and often of superior quality compared to those written by the user and other alternatives. Response time generally increases with the complexity or length of the answer. Finally, the study reviews notable takeaways from PACEM's deployment and offers suggestions for future research to address the evolving challenges in AI-driven response assessment."}, "authors": [{"id": "65818042", "name": "A.

Traditional channel estimation methods face scalability challenges due to the surging overhead in emerging high-mobility, extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (EL-MIMO), and multi-band systems. CSI extrapolation techniques mitigate these challenges by using partial CSI to infer complete CSI, significantly reducing overhead. Despite growing interest, a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art (SOTA) CSI extrapolation techniques is lacking. This paper addresses this gap by comprehensively reviewing the current status, challenges, and future directions of CSI extrapolation for the first time. Firstly, we analyze the performance metrics specific to CSI extrapolation in 6G, including extrapolation accuracy, adaption to dynamic scenarios and algorithm costs. We then review both model-driven and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approaches for time, frequency, antenna, and multi-domain CSI extrapolation. Key insights and takeaways from these methods are summarized. Given the promise of AI-driven methods in meeting performance requirements, we also examine the open-source channel datasets and simulators that could be used to train high-performance AI-driven CSI extrapolation models.

The review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and predefined inclusion criteria; ultimately, 42 empirical studies were included in the analysis. The results of the review indicate that the effectiveness of LLMs in grading is varied. These models perform well on closed-ended tasks and short-answer questions, often achieving accuracy comparable to human evaluators. However, they struggle with assessing complex, open-ended, or subjective assignments that require in-depth analysis or creativity. The quality of the prompts provided to the model and the use of detailed scoring rubrics significantly influence the accuracy and consistency of the grades generated by LLMs. The findings suggest that LLMs can support teachers by accelerating the grading process and delivering rapid feedback at scale, but they cannot fully replace human judgment. The highest effectiveness is achieved in hybrid assessment systems that combine AI-driven automatic grading with teacher oversight and verification."}, "authors": [{"id": "2363661294", "name": "Marcin Jukiewicz"}, {"id": "2165463028", "name": "M.

This index explains between 9 and 18 percent of the variation in GenAI adoption and ranks among the strongest predictors for women across all age groups, surpassing digital literacy and education for young women. Intersectional analyses show that the largest disparities arise among younger, digitally fluent individuals with high societal risk concerns, where gender gaps in personal use exceed 45 percentage points.

Incorporating reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) can mitigate these issues but complicates channel state information (CSI) acquisition. To address this, we propose a generative artificial intelligence-based hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (GAI-HDRL) framework that jointly performs channel prediction, hybrid precoding at the base station (BS), passive RIS beamforming, and digital combining at the UE to minimize transmit power. The proposed GAI-HDRL efficiently decomposes the optimization into high-level (precoding and combining) and low-level actions (CSI prediction and RIS configuration), achieving fast convergence and improved prediction accuracy. Simulation results confirm its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance and computational efficiency, demonstrating practical viability in THz communications."}, "authors": [{"id": "2319130400", "name": "A.

By conceptualising AI as part of a broader, interconnected technology ecosystem – encompassing data, connectivity, energy, compute capacity and workforce – the article introduces the notion of “architectures of AI” to describe the underlying infrastructure shaping contemporary security and sovereignty. It demonstrates how these architectures concentrate power within a select number of technology companies, which increasingly function as national security actors capable of influencing state decisions on the resort to force. The article identifies three critical factors that collectively alter the calculus of war: (i) the concentration of power across the architectures of AI, (ii) the diffusion of national security decision making, and (iii) the role of AI in shaping public opinion. It argues that, as technology companies amass unprecedented control over digital infrastructure and information flows, most nation states – particularly smaller or less technologically advanced ones – experience diminished autonomy in decisions to use force. The article specifically examines how technology companies can coerce, influence or incentivise the resort-to-force decision making of smaller states, thereby challenging traditional notions of state sovereignty and international security."}, "authors": [{"id": null, "name": "Miah Hammond-Errey"}], "fields_of_study": null}

The microgrids constantly generate a massive amount of computational requests. However, the distributed architecture of microgrids poses challenges for processing computing requests, such as limited resources at single nodes and load imbalance. In this paper, we propose FLARE, an end-edge-cloud collaboration computing architecture in microgrids, to optimize request scheduling. The optimization objective of the scheduling algorithm is to maximize long-term comprehensive utility considering factors such as delay and energy consumption. We utilize Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to tackle this NP-hard problem. To address the deployment and update issues of distributed schedulers on end devices, we introduce model pruning and Federated Learning (FL).

While realist deterrence logic assumes that the threat of mutual destruction compels rational actors to act cautiously, AI disrupts this by adding speed, opacity and algorithmic biases to decision-making processes. The article focuses on the case of Russia to explore how different understandings of deterrence among nuclear powers could increase the risk of misperceptions and inadvertent escalation in an AI-influenced strategic environment. I argue that AI does not operate in a conceptual vacuum: the effects of its integration depend on the strategic assumptions guiding its use. As such, divergent interpretations of deterrence may render AI-supported decision making more unpredictable, particularly in high-stakes nuclear contexts. I also consider how these risks intersect with broader arms race dynamics. Specifically, the pursuit of AI-enabled capabilities by global powers is not only accelerating military modernisation but also intensifying the security dilemma, as each side fears falling behind. In light of these challenges, this article calls for greater attention to conceptual divergence in deterrence thinking, alongside transparency protocols and confidence-building measures aimed at mitigating misunderstandings and promoting stability in an increasingly automated military landscape."}, "authors": [{"id": null, "name": "Luba Zatsepina"}], "fields_of_study": null}

During a controlled staging phase, the framework monitors execution traces to learn legitimate agent behaviors and input patterns. From this phase, it derives adaptive policies that regulate tool calls made by the agent, guided by both real-time input context and the control flow dependencies of multi-step agent actions. Evaluation across two real-world AI agent applications demonstrates that AgentGuardian effectively detects malicious or misleading inputs while preserving normal agent functionality.

In the logistics and supply chain industry, human-computer interaction (HCI) is essential to the achievement of technological advances. The relationship is shifting as a result of the implementation of artificial intelligence applications (Internet of Items, independent transportation, tangible internet), which increase equipment independence and, consequently, shift the duty of human workers from primary management to supervisory, which is a significant aspect of social sustainable development.

This research offers a conceptual framework, AI Constructivist Learning Model (AICLM), based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Constructivist Learning Theory (CLT). Motivation, engagement, and societal expectations, based on CLT, are identified as external variables in TAM. These three constructs support active, autonomous, and student-centered learning. A systematic search of academic databases was conducted following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Sixteen empirical studies published from 2021 to 2025, indexed in Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, were included in this review. Articles were selected on the basis of certain keywords such as, AI, English writing, TAM, and CLT. Findings indicate that students perceive the ease of use and usefulness of AI if they have high motivation, more engagement, and positive societal expectations. Therefore, motivation, engagement, and societal expectations are significant external variables that influence the attitudes of students toward AI acceptance in improving English writing. AI integration in English writing development can be successful if the interaction between the constructs of TAM and CLT is understood well. CLT supports why and how students engage actively with AI tools. Students are more likely to accept AI if it increases motivation enhances engagement and fulfils societal expectations.

This technology can enhance perceived usability and immersion, creating a more realistic online shopping experience. However, consumers still combine physical and digital experiences to ensure the best purchasing decisions. Consumers visit physical stores and purchase products online, a process known as showrooming. This phenomenon is an evolving challenge for both retail and academics. This research examines the influence of channel characteristics (antecedents) and situational characteristics (consumers’ time pressure) as a moderating variable on showrooming behavior phenomena and avoidance of regret as consequences. This research surveys a representative sample of 474 Indonesian cosmetics and skincare shoppers. This study uses SmartPLS 4.0 to analyze the data. The results prove that channel characteristics (sales-staff assistance), online channel convenience, and social influence positively affect showrooming intentions. Then, showrooming behavior helps consumers reduce uncertainty, positively impacting avoidance of regret as consequences. By integrating the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Stimulus–Organism–Behavior–Consequence (SOBC) framework, this research model provides a comprehensive understanding of how external factors influence consumers’ psychological processes, which then shape their intentions and behaviors. Ultimately, showrooming behavior results in post-purchase consequences. This model integration is expected to analyze showrooming behavior in a more holistic modern retail context. The findings of this study provide practical implications for retailers in formulating more effective strategies for managing consumer behavior in an omnichannel environment."}, "authors": [{"id": "2340122724", "name": "Lia Febria Lina"}, {"id": "2404341947", "name": "N.

This lack of transparency and clinical alignment poses major challenges for regulatory compliance and professional trust. This study proposes a novel hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) meta-model for CDSS design, which formally translates established engineering decision support paradigms into the clinical domain to create systems that are inherently safer and more explainable. The framework rigorously integrates: (i) Web Ontology Language 2 for formalizing medical concepts; (ii) a semantic web rule language rule base to serve as “clinical guardrails” for enforcing evidence-based guidelines and safety constraints; and (iii) a modular inference policy that intelligently matches decision problems with specific data-driven or probabilistic methods. A prototype was implemented, combining this explicit knowledge layer with modular inference engines and template-based explanations. Evaluation across two large-scale clinical tasks (oncology using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database and intensive care using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database) demonstrated superior performance over data-driven baselines. Specifically, the hybrid system achieved a 78% reduction in guideline-violation errors (reducing the contraindication rate from 18% to 6%) while maintaining high predictive accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.84 and 0.87, respectively). Furthermore, a clinician usability study confirmed that the transparent, knowledge-driven explanations resulted in significantly higher decision clarity (Likert rating of 6.2/7) and reduced cognitive load. The findings validate that this hybrid AI architecture represents a robust and transferable approach to designing clinically aligned, trustworthy, and explainable CDSS, directly addressing critical requirements for the responsible deployment of AI in healthcare."}, "authors": [{"id": "2354899507", "name": "N.

However, existing segmentation models suffer from inaccurate segmentation, slow processing, and large model size that limit their deployment on resource-constrained devices. To this end, we propose a lightweight model called Efficient Memory Aggregation U-shaped Network (EMAUnet) for human segmentation in video, which is based on a traditional U-shaped network and attention mechanism. In EMAUnet, memory modules are combined with segmentation modules, enabling end-to-end learning of semantic extraction patterns for human images. Mobile-inverse bottleneck convolution (MBConv) is used as the network backbone that has relatively few parameters and computational complexity. Inverted sub-pixel down-sampling (ISP) is proposed to minimize information loss and achieve detail-preserving of segmentation. Coordinate attention (CA) is adopted to precisely locate the portrait area. Moreover, bidirectional memory update (BMU) and memory update trigger (MUT) are proposed to improve memory resource utilization and reduce unnecessary computation. Experimental results show that, compared with the classic model ISNet, EMAUnet has the mIoU, FPS and pixel accuracy increased by 2.3%, 25.0% and 1.8%, respectively, while the amount of parameters and the size of model decreased by 33.3% and 45.7%, respectively."}, "authors": [{"id": "2356048149", "name": "Xiaoyao Zhang"}, {"id": "2277694734", "name": "Lan Yao"}, {"id": "2054265310", "name": "Feng Zeng"}], "fields_of_study": null}

However, traditional AI platforms tend to be black-box, so interpretability is usually limited, and it allows biases to exist that compromise trust and undermine managerial control. To overcome these issues, the present paper introduces a proposal of an explainable artificial intelligence-based decision support system to improve fairness, reliability, and policy compliance in the workflow of social-benefit distribution. Its approach combines interpretable prediction modelling, equity-sensitive modifications, uncertainty estimation, and human-in-the-loop oversight and places it into one pipeline. Quantitative analysis of synthetic and real-world welfare data demonstrates that the proposed structure removes demographic bias by 22.7% and decision under perturbations by 18.4 and greater explanation fidelity by 31.2 than non-explainable bases do. The system further enhances the consistency of the allocation by 17.5% and reduces the risk of policy-violation by 14.9 %, and at the same time, it sustains the competitive predictive accuracy. As experimental findings indicate, there might be not only the higher quality of generated balance and credible recommendations of benefits but the enhanced managerial control due to the transparency of decision rationales and audit-traceable procedures. The results emphasize the usefulness of explainable and decision-aware AI systems in facilitating socially responsible and accountable decision making towards the administration of the public good."}, "authors": [{"id": "2279599955", "name": "Shakun Garg"}, {"id": "2353561993", "name": "Amit Verma"}], "fields_of_study": null}

However, training accurate models on real-field data remains challenging due to over fitting and limited generalization. As observed in prior studies, traditional CNNs often struggle with real-environment variability, and transfer learning can lead to instability in training on domain-specific leaf datasets. This study focuses on detecting dome galls, a disease in Cordia dichotoma, by formulating a binary classification task (healthy vs. diseased leaves) using a custom dataset of 3,900 leaf images collected from real field environments. Methods Initially, both custom CNNs and transfer learning models were trained and compared. Among them, a modified ResNet-50 architecture showed promising results but suffered from over fitting and unstable convergence. To address this, the final sigmoid activation layer was replaced with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), and L2 regularization was applied to reduce over fitting. This hybrid DeepSVM architecture stabilized training and improved model robustness. Image preprocessing and augmentation techniques were applied to increase variability and prevent over fitting. Results The final model was evaluated on a separate test set of 400 images, and the results remained stable across repeated runs. DeepSVM achieved an accuracy of 94.50% and an F1-score of 94.47%, outperforming other well-known models like VGG-16, InceptionResNetv2, and MobileNet-V2.

Such AI-based tools could be integrated and potentially offer advantages over currently used diagnostic and monitoring algorithms, enabling the pursue of more individualized treatment options with potentially improved patient outcomes in the future. However, very few studies exploring the potential of AI-based tools have been reported in veterinary medicine. Diagnosis and subclassification of chronic inflammatory enteropathy (CIE) and protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), requiring an integrated approach including several diagnostic modalities, remains a challenge in clinical canine gastroenterology and might benefit from AI-based tools. Thus, we aimed to use AI-based deep learning to develop a model that can differentiate clinical cases of protein-losing PLE from non-PLE CIE using ultrasonographic (B-mode) images. This pilot study included anonymized data extracted from the electronic medical records and diagnostic images from routine diagnostic evaluations of 59 dogs. Following several optimization steps, the final model had a high accuracy (91.57%), precision (0.9286), recall (0.9070), F1 score (0.9176), and AUC-ROC (0.9529). This model was highly sensitive and specific for the detection of ultrasonographic features associated with clinicopathologic and/or histological lesions consistent with a PLE diagnosis. Combining sonographic diagnostics with machine learning yielded a high degree of accuracy in PLE differentiation. The results of this study underscore the potential of integrating an AI-based model into CIE diagnostics and PLE differentiation in clinical canine gastroenterology."}, "authors": [{"id": "2403770423", "name": "Anne-Kathrin Reichert"}, {"id": "2404426783", "name": "Kariem Ali"}, {"id": "2403735119", "name": "Amna Asif"}, {"id": "2310051346", "name": "Romy M.

Among various forms of adversarial attacks, poisoning attacks, which manipulate the training environment, pose a severe threat to the integrity and security of the trained AI/ML models. This paper first highlights the security threats of general machine learning (ML)-based methods considering different stages of the end-to-end ML pipeline that are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Next, we provide comprehensive review on poisoning attacks with a specific focus on their effects in reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods. We explore observation, policy, reward poisoning and backdoor attacks on RL, and discuss the induced implications on smart energy grid applications, specifically considering market, systems, controls, and communication perspectives. Furthermore, we examine defense mechanisms and mitigation strategies that have been proposed to safeguard RL-driven energy infrastructures from these adversarial threats. By analyzing these attacks from generic AI/ML perspective with a focus on RL as well as grid application viewpoint, this paper provides insights into current challenges and future research directions advancing the robustness of RL-based methods against such poisoning attacks, particularly in their applications in power and energy systems."}, "authors": [{"id": "2301454483", "name": "Kyung-Bin Kwon"}, {"id": "2301756876", "name": "Sayak Mukherjee"}, {"id": "35494889", "name": "Ramij Raja Hossain"}, {"id": "2291066627", "name": "Veronica Adetola"}], "fields_of_study": null}

In this work, we propose a Hierarchical Brain-Inspired Reinforcement Learning (HBRL) architecture that combines the benefits of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with a biologically inspired cognitive hierarchy. The proposed architecture functions by simulating cortical–subcortical processing of information in which a high-level Policy-Gradient manager conducts abstract and long-term planning, and the low-level Deep Q-Network (DQN) agents complete real-time short-term actions. The proposed architecture’s multilayer structure includes temporal abstraction, modular learning, and the ability to refine policies to optimize experience, which makes it appropriate for dynamic and uncertain environments. We applied HBRL in three common scenarios: GridWorld, autonomous vehicle navigation, and smart-city infrastructure control to evaluate the proposed system design. Overall, we found that HBRL had a 15%–20% higher rate of completing tasks, 1.4–2.4 times faster learning efficiency, along with 70–100 points higher cumulative reward when high-level and low-level HBRL agents were compared to baseline approaches (e.g., DQN, Proximal Policy Optimization, and Soft Actor-Critic). A statistical analysis using two-tailed t-tests also assessed the significance of improvements (p < 0.01) among all tested environments. The hierarchical decomposition of tasks serves both to promote convergence and improve agents’ generalization capacity in unseen conditions. In its entirety, the proposed HBRL framework provides a scalable and cognitive-inspired learning paradigm for developing intelligent autonomous systems that exhibit human-likeadaptability and efficient decision-making capabilities in complex, nonstationary real-world environments.\n \nReceived: 14 May 2025 | Revised: 16 October 2025 | Accepted: 19 December 2025\n \nConflicts of Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest to this work.\n \nData Availability Statement\nData sharing is not applicable to this article as no new data were created or analyzed in this study.\n \nAuthor Contribution Statement\nKanthavel Radhakrishnan: Conceptualization, Methodology, Formal analysis, Resources, Data curation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review & editing, Visualization.

These gains are attractive, but in a regulated environment speed is never enough. Regulators want assurance that every system is reliable, that decisions are explainable, and that human accountability remains central. This paper sets out a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) AI approach for Computer System Validation (CSV) and Computer Software Assurance (CSA). It relies on explainable AI (XAI) tools but keeps structured human review in place, so automation can be used without creating gaps in trust or accountability. Within this framework, AI provides draft recommendations such as mapping user requirements, highlighting redundant tests, or classifying deviations while subject matter experts (SMEs) review, adjust, and approve the final outcomes. Features like rationale cards, confidence bands, and traceable recommendations give SMEs the information they need to understand and, when necessary, challenge AI outputs. The framework is also supported by governance measures. These include model risk tiering to match oversight with potential impact, periodic model challenges to detect drift, and “evidence packs” that bring together AI outputs, human decisions, and audit trails into an inspection-ready format. Taken together, these safeguards show inspectors that automation is being used responsibly, not recklessly. We validate the approach in a two-project pilot, reporting mean cycle-time reductions of 32% (95% CI: 25%–38%) and higher inter-rater agreement (κ from 0.71 → 0.85), achieved under a defined governance model that includes model-risk tiering, quarterly challenge testing for high-risk models, and inspection-ready evidence packs aligned to 21 CFR Part 11 and Annex 11. These results provide preliminary empirical support so that HITL AI can improve efficiency and reviewer consistency while preserving accountability and regulatory trust. Practical case examples demonstrate that HITL AI can shorten validation cycles by 25%–40% while also improving reviewer consistency and strengthening inspector confidence. Rather than replacing SMEs, the system frees them from repetitive work so they can focus on risk and quality the areas where their judgment adds the most value. By blending automation with accountability, HITL AI provides a path for digital transformation that regulators are more likely to accept, positioning it as both a productivity tool and a model for sustainable compliance in the years ahead."}, "authors": [{"id": null, "name": "Manaliben Amin"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Understanding the mechanisms through which artificial intelligence acceptance affects job crafting is critical for optimizing workforce adaptation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis longitudinal study employed a three-wave cross-lagged panel design. A total of 598 nurses from six tertiary hospitals in China completed surveys on artificial intelligence acceptance, decent work perception, and job crafting over a six-month period. Structural equation modeling and bootstrap analysis were used to test longitudinal mediation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nArtificial intelligence acceptance showed declining stability over time, while decent work perception increased, and job crafting stabilized. Cross-lagged analyses revealed that artificial intelligence acceptance positively predicted job crafting both directly and indirectly via enhanced decent work perception. The mediating effect accounted for over one-quarter of the total effect.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nThese findings challenge static views of technology adoption, suggesting that artificial intelligence implementation triggers dynamic psychological and behavioral responses among nurses.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nEarly acceptance of artificial intelligence technology significantly predicts subsequent job crafting, both directly and through the mediating role of decent work perception.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING\nEnhancing nurses' early acceptance of artificial intelligence and strengthening their perception of decent work may foster more proactive job crafting behaviors.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING POLICY\nNurse managers and policymakers should incorporate psychological support and dignity-enhancing strategies into artificial intelligence integration plans.

Perubahan ini tidak hanya berdampak pada aspek teknis pembelajaran dan manajemen pendidikan, tetapi juga memunculkan tantangan filosofis dan etis terkait orientasi nilai, tujuan pendidikan, serta relasi manusia dengan teknologi. Dalam perspektif filsafat manajemen pendidikan Islam, teknologi tidak diposisikan sebagai tujuan akhir, melainkan sebagai wasilah (alat) untuk mewujudkan nilai-nilai maqasid al-shariah dan kemaslahatan umat. Artikel ini bertujuan untuk menganalisis integrasi nilai-nilai tauhid dengan teknologi digital dalam kerangka filsafat manajemen pendidikan Islam. Penelitian ini menggunakan pendekatan kualitatif deskriptif dengan desain conceptual literature review. Data dikumpulkan dari literatur klasik pemikir Islam seperti Al-Ghazali dan Ibn Khaldun, serta literatur kontemporer yang membahas filsafat pendidikan, etika teknologi, dan transformasi digital, antara lain Nasr, Jasser Auda, Selwyn, serta Hussain dan Khan. Analisis data dilakukan menggunakan pendekatan hermeneutik-filosofis untuk menggali makna, nilai, dan relevansi konsep-konsep tersebut dalam konteks pendidikan digital. Hasil kajian menunjukkan bahwa filsafat manajemen pendidikan Islam berfungsi sebagai kerangka normatif dan strategis dalam mengarahkan digitalisasi pendidikan agar tetap berorientasi pada nilai, etika, dan spiritualitas. Integrasi nilai tauhid melahirkan model konseptual Manajemen Pendidikan Islam Digital Integratif (MPIDI) yang terdiri dari empat komponen utama, yaitu nilai tauhid, etika digital, teknologi, dan kemaslahatan umat. Model ini menegaskan bahwa keberhasilan transformasi digital dalam pendidikan Islam tidak hanya ditentukan oleh kesiapan teknologi, tetapi juga oleh kesiapan nilai, kesadaran etis, dan kedalaman spiritual."}, "authors": [{"id": "144412809", "name": "H.

Various failure modes and mechanisms can occur during their practical use. However, efficient methods and experience for analyzing AI chip failures are still lacking. This paper presents a failure analysis method for AI chips that combines electrical testing and physical optics. The method mainly consists of three steps. Firstly, preliminary inspection through electrical characteristic testing to identify failed chips. Then, the precise localization of the fault position of AI chips is based on physical optics. Finally, mechanistic analysis of the fault location using micro-analysis techniques. Experimental analysis shows that the provided method can effectively detect the specific fault location of the AI chip and identify its failure mechanism, providing a reference for future failure analysis and reliability improvement of AI chips."}, "authors": [{"id": "2222389808", "name": "Shuiquan Pang"}, {"id": "2405482909", "name": "Zhongjun Chen"}, {"id": "2405527235", "name": "Jianming Fang"}, {"id": "2282030065", "name": "Yue Zhao"}, {"id": "2312274594", "name": "Jun Luo"}, {"id": "2405069599", "name": "Gaoming Shi"}], "fields_of_study": ["Engineering"]}

However, beneath the glorious appearance of the rapid development of AI technology, increasingly serious environmental problems are gradually emerging. To train and operate AI systems, power demand from data centers has skyrocketed, having tripled in just five years and being expected to triple again by 2030 [1]. This staggering increase starkly contrasts with less than 3% of annual global electricity production growth witnessed over the past 40 years, far outpaced by AI's ballooning energy needs [2], as shown in Figure 1 left. If we continue down this path relying on traditional processors, the growth of large language models (LLMs) may soon reach an unsustainable ceiling. This urgency is amplified by the reality that early efficiency gains in AI hardware are plateauing. Data centers nowadays principally utilize GPUs for both training and inferences. While GPU manufacturers often highlight improvements in efficiency—claiming a 40,000x improvement over the past decade—these numbers obscure several underlying concerns [3]. Upon scrutinizing the sources of the improvement, it becomes evident that sustaining such a pace of progress will be fraught with challenges. The main drivers of efficiency enhancement stem from circuit/architecture innovations, semiconductor process advancements, and data format optimizations."}, "authors": [{"id": "2317832938", "name": "Hechen Wang"}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science"]}

This paper will address the role of AI-driven knowledge integration (AIEKI) as regulated by innovation, such as the digital absorptive capacity (DAC), and ethical guidance, such as ethical knowledge curation (EKC) in the same breath. This paper aims to investigate the impact of these factors on the economic performance and sustainable innovation performance of an organization.\n \n \n \n As a quantitative study, a survey was mailed to 295 IT professionals in various locations. To determine the quality of fit of this study’s model, item validity and data reliability, the authors used structural equation modeling (SEM) through partial least squares-based SEM.\n \n \n \n The findings reveal that AI-enabled knowledge integration improves digital absorptive capacity and ethical knowledge curation. The fact that these elements also play a crucial role in enhancing sustainable innovation performance underscores the importance of incorporating artificial intelligence in the value creation process. In addition, it was found that knowledge system complexity influenced certain of these relationships, indicating that the more complex the system was, the stronger the sociomaterial connections.\n \n \n \n The findings are highly practical and offer clear recommendations for practitioners. Managers need to move beyond the focus on artificial intelligence technology and tool sets to the investment on the integrated sociomaterial capabilities of digital absorptive capacity and ethical knowledge curation. In other words, they will be able to roll out training initiatives to teach their employees how to integrate artificial intelligence with DAC. They can also stress on the importance of sound governance practices. This two-faceted strategy is effective in making AI-enabled innovations not only economical, but also socially accountable and sustainable.\n \n \n \n Such research has the value of originality because (a) it conducts robust empirical evidence of the sociomateriality theory in terms of knowledge processes and AI (b) and translates the artificial intelligence ethics discussion into practice, branding the field of curating knowledge ethically (CKE) as a digital absorptive capacity (capability) (c).

This article critically examines how generative artificial intelligence, while often celebrated for accessibility and linguistic support, can foster learner dependency and undermine the development of sustained cognitive engagement. Drawing on extended classroom observations and reflective teaching practice within a United Arab Emirates higher education context, the study identifies recurring patterns of disengagement, superficial linguistic understanding, and a growing reluctance to grapple with language complexity. These behaviors are conceptualized through the notion of the Brat Brain, a metaphor used to describe a learner mindset that resists effort and critical thinking, demands instant solutions, and privileges convenience over intellectual growth. Rather than asking how to improve their writing or speaking, students increasingly question why such effort is necessary when artificial intelligence can produce faster and seemingly superior outputs. Reframing artificial intelligence use through the good, the bad, and the (educationally) evil, the article offers a critical lens for evaluating both the affordances and the unintended consequences of artificial fluency in language education.

Drawing from 127 peer-reviewed studies, industry reports, we analyze effectiveness metrics including accident reduction rates, false positive/negative ratios, response time improvements, and cost-benefit outcomes. Our findings demonstrate that AI-enabled safety systems achieve an average 34.7% reduction in preventable accidents across analyzed domains, with significant variation by sector (range: 18-61%). Advanced driver assistance systems show the highest impact (42-61% accident reduction), while industrial predictive maintenance systems demonstrate 31-38% reductions in critical failures. However, implementation challenges including algorithmic bias, transparency deficits, and human-AI interaction failures partially offset these gains. We propose a standardized framework for evaluating AI safety technology effectiveness and identify critical research gaps in long-term reliability assessment and ethical deployment considerations."}, "authors": [{"id": null, "name": "Adil Shah"}, {"id": "2381426973", "name": "Md Nurul Huda Razib"}, {"id": "2404336074", "name": "Shanzida Kabir"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Sampling-based traditional auditing has several challenges with identifying anomalies or new risks in financial information environments that are becoming increasingly complex and more data-rich.\n \n \n \n In this study, AI-based techniques (machine learning and natural language processing) will be applied to a number of the steps involved in auditing financial information. The predictive model will be applied to lead propensity analysis and business volume forecasting, allowing the examination of both structured and unstructured data on financial statements and protecting the privacy of client data.\n \n \n \n A predictive model utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) was able to identify leads at an 87% rate of accuracy; forecasted business volume errors were less than 5%; and it explained nearly 94% of the variance between the AI model’s predictions and the actual loan disbursement amounts. Using AI for full dataset analysis instead of sample-based methods improved auditors’ ability to detect anomalies and allocate resources efficiently.\n \n \n \n Overall, the research demonstrates that AI provides auditors the capability to evaluate all data for a company, automate routine tasks, and identify specific areas (high-risk/high-value) that may require further review compared to other auditing methods. The new methodology also allows for early identification of potential risks and improves the overall efficiency of audits without compromising the protection of the companies’ data.\n"}, "authors": [{"id": "118830044", "name": "Amar Johri"}, {"id": "2377005621", "name": "Anu Sayal"}, {"id": "2335946150", "name": "Kim Mee Chong"}, {"id": "2320039749", "name": "Maysoon Khoja"}, {"id": "2215954607", "name": "Chaithra N"}, {"id": "2215913005", "name": "Janhvi Jha"}, {"id": "2406569569", "name": "Neha Tyagi"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Artificial intelligence is increasingly replacing human decision-making in many aspects of life, and the legal domain is no exception. Consequently, it is essential to explore how these technologies can contribute to the development and drafting of laws, as well as the challenges they may pose to existing legal frameworks.\nWhile this progress raises complex legal challenges that require careful analysis, artificial intelligence also offers promising opportunities to enhance the quality and effectiveness of legislation. This study therefore seeks to analyze the role of artificial intelligence in the legislative process, with a focus on the opportunities and challenges it presents in this context. The first section examines the role of artificial intelligence in the legal field in general, while the second section is devoted specifically to its role in improving the quality of legislation. In this regard, the study explores how artificial intelligence can be used to analyze vast amounts of legal data, thereby enhancing legislators’ ability to make more informed and accurate decisions. It also examines how artificial intelligence can simplify legal processes, increase productivity, and contribute to the drafting of legislation that is flexible and capable of adapting to rapid societal changes. Furthermore, the study addresses the ethical and legal implications arising from the use of these technologies, with a view to ensuring a balance between innovation and the preservation of fundamental legal values and principles"}, "authors": [{"id": "148775829", "name": "مصطفى الفوركي"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Using a qualitative research design with a library research approach, this study synthesizes conceptual and empirical literature from marketing, finance, and strategic management to examine how AI-driven marketing insights contribute to firm performance. The analysis reveals that AI-driven marketing insights play a critical role in improving decision quality, marketing efficiency, and financial accountability by linking marketing activities directly to measurable financial outcomes such as revenue growth, cost optimization, and return on investment. Furthermore, the integration of AI capabilities into marketing analytics strengthens firms’ ability to develop sustainable competitive advantage through superior customer understanding, faster market responsiveness, and enhanced strategic alignment between marketing and finance functions. The findings also highlight the importance of organizational integration and data-driven culture in maximizing the financial value of AI adoption.

Explainable artificial intelligence has emerged to address this challenge; however, most existing approaches rely exclusively on global or local analyses, which fail to capture the heterogeneity of model behavior across patient populations. In this paper, we introduce the clustered partial explanation (CPE) framework, a novel three‐level methodology comprising global, partial, and local analyses, designed to bridge this gap. The proposed framework combines cluster‐based subgrouping with explainable artificial intelligence techniques to uncover latent variations in feature influence and model behavior. We apply the proposed framework to a breast cancer survival prediction task using a Random Forest model trained on the SEER dataset. The resulting partial explanations reveal heterogeneous feature importance patterns across clusters, highlighting interactions that remain obscured under global analysis. By validating global explanations at the subgroup level, the proposed framework enhances both interpretability and reliability, thereby supporting context‐aware clinical decision‐making. Finally, we discuss the implications of this additional interpretability layer for future research."}, "authors": [{"id": "8691742", "name": "Khadija Letrache"}, {"id": "2277662511", "name": "Mohammed Ramdani"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Generally, structures have positive stiffness combined with damping during earthquake-induced oscillations, which leads to energy loss and causes a reduction in the amplitude of the vibration. However, when a structure falls into the nonlinear region of a structure, the appearance of negative stiffness is possible. If this occurs, then the mathematical solution of equation of motion is changed drastically. This is the exact point covered by the present article and a suitable procedure (namely the key-point) for ML is given. This paper aims to define and solve the mathematical equation of motion for a Single Degree of Freedom (SDoF) oscillator with damping and negative stiffness due to various dynamic loading conditions. The derived solutions indicate that, for every case of dynamic loading, oscillation with negative stiffness is absent, and the structure’s response increases exponentially. The abovementioned facts are verified by the presentation of a benchmark example that gives the exact values of response of a SDoF system with negative stiffness."}, "authors": [{"id": "2829817", "name": "T.

However, many existing implementations rely on centralized architectures, which introduce security and privacy concerns while also increasing communication overhead. Limited research has explored the development of distributed generative models, particularly in scenarios where training data originate from various heterogeneous sources. To fill the gap, this article introduces a distributed generative model framework aimed at enhancing data generation in hierarchical IoT systems. The proposed framework supports distributed data generation across three distinct scenarios: feature-related data, label-related data, and feature-label nonrelated data. Furthermore, both synchronous and asynchronous update mechanisms are incorporated to accommodate diverse application requirements within IoT environments. Comprehensive experiments using simulated, image, and tabular datasets are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed framework in comparison with state-of-the-art methods. The results indicate that the framework effectively produces high-quality synthetic data while preserving the integrity of downstream tasks. Beyond large language models (LLMs), these findings suggest that generative AI has the potential to transform data generation in distributed IoT systems and be extended to a broader range of applications."}, "authors": [{"id": "152624701", "name": "Zuobin Xiong"}, {"id": "2256598234", "name": "Wei Li"}, {"id": "51166394", "name": "Yingshu Li"}, {"id": "2268022687", "name": "Zhipeng Cai"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the state-of-the-art for processing 2-D image data, but their high computational and data requirements limit their use in resource-constrained environments. Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) offers a lightweight alternative, excelling in 1-D tasks, but struggles to achieve competitive accuracy for 2-D image classification. Hybrid frameworks combining HDC with CNNs have been proposed to improve accuracy but inherit the computational demands of deep learning, making them unsuitable for edge and IoT devices. To address this, we propose TransHD, a framework integrating lightweight spatial transformer networks (STNs) with HDC to enhance image classification performance while maintaining efficiency. TransHD achieves up to 9% higher accuracy than base HDC models on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST using only 30% of the training data, and reduces computational complexity by 2.5x through optimized STN feature map usage. On resource-constrained platforms like the Raspberry Pi 4, TransHD accelerates inference times by 3.4x and improves energy efficiency by 3.2x, with an accuracy trade-off of approximately 3% compared with CNNs.

However, the practical implementation of ML in critical real-world applications remains constrained due to the concerns on building reliable ML model. To address this challenge, ensuring model reliability requires a focus on three major aspects: credibility, adaptability, and interpretability. To achieve these objectives in a unified way, a new reliable learning pattern which consists of training, adaptation, testing, and second decision stage was proposed to extend the traditional training-testing pattern. Based on this framework, a new evidential reasoning rule learning (ER2L) strategy was developed, where individual-reliability is defined to tune the trained model for fitting the test sample better in adaptation stage and overall-reliability is introduced to measure the credibility of the model outputs for the second decision. Furthermore, due to ER2's nature as a probabilistic inference engine, the model is interpretable. Building on ER2L, a new ML approach termed Naïve ER2 (NER2) was proposed. The experimental studies demonstrated that NER2 can obtain better performance by introducing individual-reliability for model tuning, whilst the overall-reliability can evaluate the credibility of model output reasonably."}, "authors": [{"id": "2293266316", "name": "Zhiguo Zhou"}, {"id": "2348453319", "name": "Hui Liu"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly significant role in medicine and has the potential to assist not only specialists but also other medical professionals in detecting fractures based on X-ray and CT scans.

Summary of publicly available publications and studies comparing the effectiveness of AI and physicians in recognizing bone fractures.\nMaterials and methodology. A review of the literature available on PubMed, Google Scholar and Scopus was conducted.\nConclusions. The use of artificial intelligence algorithms can reduce the time required for fracture detection to as little as one minute. AI is better at identifying fractures that are difficult for humans to detect but struggles with more obvious and visible fractures. Artificial intelligence has the same or lower sensitivity and specificity in fracture detection as a specialist doctor but achieves higher accuracy compared to a resident doctor or a general practitioner.\nSummary. Based on the analyzed studies, it can be observed that artificial intelligence  will prove useful as an aid; a suggestion in diagnosis for a young doctor, but does not replace specialist doctors, who achieve higher accuracy in detecting fractures on X-rays and CT scans. Furthermore, it is worth reconsidering the reanalysis of existing studies and comparing AI results not only with human knowledge but also with CT scans, as they are considered more reliable."}, "authors": [{"id": "2392154693", "name": "Maria Kasprzak"}, {"id": "2392158420", "name": "Damian Osiński"}, {"id": "2392153385", "name": "Zuzanna Kawa"}, {"id": "2392153588", "name": "Aleksandra Jędrzejewska"}, {"id": "2392153340", "name": "Aleksandra Jureczko"}, {"id": "2183643174", "name": "Klaudia Kleczaj"}, {"id": "2392156700", "name": "Valentyna Levadna"}, {"id": "2392153108", "name": "Julia Jaworowska"}, {"id": "2392153095", "name": "Gabriela Babiarz"}, {"id": "2392155992", "name": "Julia Kanarszczuk"}], "fields_of_study": null}

The model was tested with survey data from 384 English teachers in Arab schools under Israeli jurisdiction using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Results show that perceived ethical commitment and competence in artificial intelligence–related pedagogy strongly predict teachers’ intention to use these tools ethically; this intention, in turn, is the strongest predictor of student learning outcomes, exceeding the effect of reported classroom practices. Effort expectancy and social influence did not meaningfully predict ethical intention. Gender, age, teaching experience, and prior use of artificial intelligence showed no significant differences or associations with ethical attitudes.

While global debates on artificial intelligence ethics usually center on secular or practical structures, the Greek Orthodox heritage brings a distinct moral dimension inspired by spiritual anthropology, the theology of the human person, and the notion of heavenly likeness. The study looks at Greek consumers' perceptions of artificial intelligence from ethical, moral, and religious angles depending on data gathered from the author's Ph.D. dissertation (omitted for blind review). It examines the degree to which religion influences public opinion, acceptance, and emotional engagement with smart systems. The research reveals that individuals occasionally evaluate artificial intelligence (AI) not only for its utility but also for its fit with their moral values, spiritual integrity, and freedom. By fusing Orthodox ethical principles with modern AI debate, this paper presents a novel conceptual framework: the Theological-Moral Framing Model of AI. This theory clarifies how group and individual reactions to new technologies are influenced by cultural identity, moral narratives, and religious beliefs. The paper argues that in Greece and other faith-based nations, developing culturally sensitive AI management and public relations strategies depends on an awareness of this religious aspect. \n  \nReceived: 25 November 2025 / Accepted: 30 December 2025 / Published: January 2026"}, "authors": [{"id": "2404912133", "name": "Theofanis Aritzis"}], "fields_of_study": null}

This study aimed to assess the performance of machine learning (ML) models to predict SGA at birth among Chinese pregnancies classified according to the Chinese birthweight standard and three international birthweight standards. Methods We collected multimodal, longitudinal, antenatal surveillance data on 350,135 singleton pregnancies in Wenzhou City, China, between Jan 1, 2014 and Dec 31, 2016. For three pregnancy intervals we developed ML prediction models for newborns classified as SGA using the China, Intergrowth 21st, Fetal Medicine Foundation (FMF), and Gestation-related Optimal Weight (GROW) standards. We applied lasso regression to conduct feature selection, and CatBoost, XGBoost, LightBoost, Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forest, Stacked ensemble model, and logistic regression for predictive modeling in training data sets, with validation in testing data sets. Results Among 22,603 singleton pregnancies with complete data, the rate of SGA using the China standard was 6.1%, compared to 4.3, 6.0, and 9.7% for the Intergrowth 21st, GROW, and FMF standards, respectively. This pattern was maintained in the imputed data set (n = 225,523), with corresponding SGA rates of 6.8, 4.8, 7.4, and 10.7%. Late pregnancy models (<37 weeks) had the best power to predict SGA, compared to middle (<26 weeks) and early pregnancy (<18 weeks) models. With the China standard, the logistic regression model in late pregnancy performed best with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.74. Logistic regression also performed better than ML algorithms with the Intergrowth-21st and GROW standards at each pregnancy interval, although differences were small. The Random Forest model with the FMF standard achieved superior performance at each pregnancy interval, reaching a ROC-AUC of 0.79 in late pregnancy. Notably, the middle pregnancy Random Forest model with the FMF standard already attained a ROC-AUC of 0.72 at 26 weeks’ gestation. Symphysis-fundal height, maternal abdominal circumference, maternal age, maternal height and weight, and parity were consistently identified as key predictors of SGA across the different standards. Conclusion There are important differences in the classification of SGA at birth between national and international birthweight standards. Both machine learning models and traditional logistic regression demonstrated comparable predictive performance for SGA identification. These findings hold promise for guiding risk-stratified prenatal care and optimizing resource allocation in clinical settings."}, "authors": [{"id": "2153795638", "name": "Qiu-Yan Yu"}, {"id": "2290103464", "name": "Ying Lin"}, {"id": "2289773574", "name": "Yu-Run Zhou"}, {"id": "2289789862", "name": "Xin-Jun Yang"}, {"id": "7259245", "name": "J.

However, most current process planning methods still heavily rely on manual expertise, leading to problems such as difficulty in knowledge reuse, low planning efficiency, and slow response times, which are inadequate to meet the diverse and changing needs of engineering applications. To address these issues, this paper proposes an algorithm for Assembly Process Reasoning and Decision-making based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory with Attention (AP-BiLSTM-ATT), which aims to deeply explore the hidden relationships between the multi-dimensional features of parts and process plans, thereby achieving probabilistic modeling of process decisions. Specifically, the attributes, geometric features, and historical process plans of parts are first labeled and vectorized, transforming traditional process knowledge into structured data representations suitable for deep learning models. A BiLSTM network model, integrated with a multi-head attention mechanism, is then constructed to capture contextual dependencies and semantic weight distributions between features, enhancing the model’s ability to express complex process relationships. During training, the model learns the mapping distribution between features and processes from a large-scale historical process dataset, enabling intelligent reasoning and recommendation of process plans for new parts. The results show that this method outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy, response speed, and generalization ability in process planning, providing effective support for enhancing the intelligence of complex part process planning and laying a foundation for the structured expression and intelligent application of manufacturing process knowledge."}, "authors": [{"id": "2333896262", "name": "Wei Yang"}, {"id": "2288120083", "name": "Jinyan Liang"}, {"id": "2217919052", "name": "Xiaoyu Zhang"}, {"id": "2269759310", "name": "Xiting Peng"}], "fields_of_study": ["Medicine"]}

Most existing approaches are domain-specific and struggle to generalize across diverse plant organs or varying image qualities. To address this challenge, we propose a novel domain-independent classification framework that integrates quality-metric features—Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)—with an adapted lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is the first approach that explores quality measures as features for addressing challenges of classification of fruits and leaves infected by virus, fungus, and bacteria. The method first performs connected-component analysis on K-means clusters generated from R, G, B, and Gray channels to isolate disease-relevant regions and extract quality-based features. These features are fused with visual features extracted from the RGB images using a multimodal CNN architecture. Extensive experiments conducted on the proposed fruit–leaf dataset and four external benchmark datasets demonstrate that the model achieves high accuracy, strong robustness to blur, noise, rotation, and scaling, and superior generalization performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. Cross-domain evaluations further confirm that the proposed method is domain-independent and reliable for the classification of fruits and leaves infected by bacteria, fungi, and viruses.\n \nReceived: 24 September 2025 | Revised: 2 December 2025 | Accepted: 25 December 2025\n \nConflicts of Interest\nPalaiahnakote Shivakumara is the Editor-in-Chief for Artificial Intelligence and Applications, and he is not involved in the editorial review or the decision to publish this article.

The central aim is to protect U.S. critical infrastructure networks from the dynamic threats posed by cyber-physical attacks. A mixed-methods approach was utilized in a longitudinal case study that examined two U.S. critical infrastructure sectors: energy and transportation. Agile methodologies were integrated through the implementation of DevSecOps pipelines, which incorporated Scrum-at-scale and automated security testing within continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows. Moreover, sophisticated cybersecurity controls were implemented through zero-trust architecture, behavioral anomaly detection, and automated threat hunting. Predictive business analytics utilized machine learning models, including isolation forest, LSTM neural networks, and graph-based attack prediction, which were trained on historical incident data, real-time telemetry, and open-source threat intelligence feeds. A consolidated \"Security-by-Design\" platform enabled integration, merging Agile sprint cycles with continuous risk assessment and predictive threat forecasting. The integrated framework's effectiveness was evidenced by a 68% reduction in mean time to detect (MTTD) sophisticated threats and a 74% decrease in mean time to respond (MTTR) when compared to traditional waterfall-based security operations. Predictive analytics demonstrated a 91% accuracy rate in forecasting attack vectors a full 72 hours before their actual occurrence. Moreover, Agile methodologies permitted security teams to implement countermeasures at a rate 14 times faster than that of legacy change-management processes, all while complying with NIST 800-53 and CISA directive. Resilience assessments indicated that integrated systems withstood simulated nation-state attacks for a period 4.3 times longer than their non-integrated counterparts. Practical Implications – U.S. critical infrastructure operators can employ the proposed DevSecOps-enabled predictive security model to meet the requirements outlined in Executive Order 14028 and CISA’s performance goals. Originality/Value – This study presents the one of the first large-scale empirically evaluated frameworks that operationally combines Agile development speed, zero-trust cybersecurity principles, and predictive analytics at scale, specifically designed for the safeguarding of U.S. critical infrastructure, moving from theoretical convergence to observable, real-world resilience."}, "authors": [{"id": "2287981037", "name": "Tanvir Ahmed Abir"}, {"id": "2406530930", "name": "Md Abu Zehad Foysal"}, {"id": "2406525190", "name": "Shila Das"}, {"id": "2406532937", "name": "Yousuf Md Shahan"}, {"id": "2406779664", "name": "Aftaha Ahmed"}, {"id": "2406511765", "name": "Sanjida Akter"}], "fields_of_study": null}

The present paper addresses the introduction of DropShipment business models against the backdrop of the associated process automation. Process automation plays a critical role in ensuring fast and efficient process execution at high order volumes. Consequently, the introduction of dropshipping also places extensive demands on the automation of business processes. While full process automation is technically feasible, it is subject to practical limitations. To this end, the dropshipping business model is analyzed in this paper with a focus on the technical implementation of automated business processes. The areas of action necessary for the implementation of automated dropshipping processes are analyzed. The analysis is based on a survey that examines the overall importance of the business model, the contribution of key action areas to developing integration solutions supporting automated processes, and future IT requirements. In the course of the survey, 19 to 21 dual Bachelor students in Computer Science and Business Informatics were asked for their assessments. The majority of respondents have no prior knowledge of DropShipping, so the survey results primarily reflect their spontaneous assessments after receiving an introduction to the topic. The study concludes that the DropShipping business model will gain increasing importance in the future. Furthermore, it became evident that requirements analysis, in particular, represents a significant effort while offering high value in developing integration solutions for automated process handling. The data analysis shows that the cost-benefit potential of using artificial intelligence methods to enable automated processes is optimal. Finally, it was found that creating automated DropShipping processes requires, to a particularly high degree, the expertise of software developers."}, "authors": [{"id": "2405968958", "name": "David Kuhlen"}], "fields_of_study": null}

This paper provides a structured, evidence-based synthesis of UAV applications in smart cities and their associated security challenges as reported in the literature over the last decade, with particular emphasis on developments from 2019 to 2025. We categorize these challenges into two primary classes: 1) cyber-attacks targeting the communication infrastructure of UAVs and 2) unwanted or unauthorized physical intrusions by UAVs themselves. We examine the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in developing intrusion detection mechanisms to mitigate these security threats. We analyze how AI-based methods, such as machine/deep learning for anomaly detection and computer vision for object recognition, can play a pivotal role in enhancing UAV security through unified detection systems that address both cyber and physical threats. Furthermore, we consolidate publicly available UAV datasets across network traffic and vision modalities suitable for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) development and evaluation.

To address this, we propose an LLM-based MambaFormer hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for efficient medical question-answering (QA) and clinical assistance. The MambaFormer employs a lightweight gating mechanism that performs token-level dynamic routing to a customized Transformer expert (ET5) for short, complex queries or to a State Space Model expert (EMamba) for long, high-throughput sequences. The customized EMamba and ET5 models are tailored to accommodate input sequence dimensionality, embedding structure, sequence length, and target-specific output heads, and are fine-tuned through transfer learning on a new, custom-designed DentalQA dataset. Moreover, intelligent routing decisions are driven by the contextual complexity of token embeddings, normalized sequence length, and domain-aware features, thereby enforcing a Pareto-optimal trade-off between inference latency and prediction accuracy. Furthermore, a novel utility-guided multi-objective loss jointly optimizes decisions, router parameters, routing behavior, expert utilization, and computational cost by adaptively regulating token-level expert activation. Finally, the proposed MambaFormer is cross-validated (holdout) for medical QA on the new, custom-designed DentalQA and PubMedQA datasets and compared with state-of-the-art techniques.

RSwinV2 has further developed based on SwinTransformer and has included patch and position embeddings to take advantage of the transformer global-linking capability by employing multi-head attention in these embeddings. Furthermore, RSwinV2 has developed and incorporated the Inverse Residual Block (IRB) into this method, which utilizes convolutional skip connections with these inclusive designs to address the vanishing gradient issues during processing. RSwinV2 inclusion of IRB has therefore facilitated this method to link global patterns as well as local patterns; hence, its integrity has helped improve lesion classification capability by minimizing variability of Mpox and increasing differences of Mpox, chickenpox, measles, and cowpox. In testing SwinV2, its accuracy of 96.51 and an F1score of 96.13 have been achieved on the Kaggle public dataset, which has outperformed standard CNN models and SwinTransformers; the RSwinV2 vector has thus proved its validity as a computer-assisted tool for Mpox lesion observation interpretation."}, "authors": [{"id": "2267339416", "name": "Rashid Iqbal"}, {"id": "2397487912", "name": "Saddam Hussain Khan Artificial Intelligence Lab"}, {"id": "2264923335", "name": "Department of Chemical Engineering"}, {"id": "2267334448", "name": "University of Engineering"}, {"id": "88668084", "name": "A.

Realising these objectives necessitates a shift from the traditional correctional system to a digital, intelligent, and data-driven approach, encompassing the gathering and analysis of information within correctional facilities to identify and mitigate hazards. Intelligence-driven corrections deploy correctional intelligence, data analysis, specialized software, and databases for mapping complicated relationships, assessing forensic evidence, and exchanging information across jurisdictions. They apply data analytics to foresee prospective dangers, such as the likelihood of violence, contraband introduction, or jail riots. The research examines enhanced corrections and intelligence-based advances in modern correctional services. A mixed-method approach was utilised, integrating qualitative and quantitative designs. Interviews, surveys, and secondary data were employed. The research indicated that more intelligent corrections utilise technology and data to oversee inmates, personnel, and visitors, minimise expenses, and enhance public safety and security. Intelligence-driven corrections utilise gathered and analysed intelligence to guide decision-making and resource distribution within correctional facilities, hence improving safety and security by recognising dangers and thwarting criminal activity. Digital technologies improve offender management, security, safety, surveillance, and efficiency through the use of biometrics, facial recognition, artificial intelligence, data analytics, robotics, and drone detection. Artificial intelligence in correctional services improves safety through real-time behaviour surveillance and incident identification, enhances efficiency by automating administrative functions, and offers personalised rehabilitation through customised educational and mental health initiatives, ultimately seeking to diminish recidivism. Blockchain technology in correctional systems provides improved security, transparency, and efficiency, especially in monitoring inmate movements and preserving the integrity of evidence. Evidence-based risk assessment facilitates tailored rehabilitation programs that aid in crime reduction. The study advocated for the adoption and implementation of advanced correction methods, intelligence-driven strategies, technological innovations, and digital devices to improve safety and security in South Africa, other African countries, and worldwide."}, "authors": [{"id": "121472836", "name": "C.

This paper proposes a unifying framework in which cognition is understood as an organizational property of living systems, grounded in information embodied in their physical structures and in their ongoing interactions with the environment. Within this info-computational (ICON) perspective, living systems engage in behavior, learning, and anticipation by dynamically transforming embodied information through distributed, physically realized processes that support viability and self-maintenance. These processes are present from the onset of life and become progressively more integrated and temporally extended with increasing biological organization. The framework provides explanatory continuity across biological scales and clarifies how complex forms of cognition, awareness, and mind arise as elaborations of basic life-regulatory dynamics. It generates empirically grounded, testable implications for basal cognition, developmental biology, and embodied artificial systems, in the domains such as morphogenetic regulation, bioelectric control, and embodied physical architectures where its implications can be tested."}, "authors": [{"id": "1403731773", "name": "G.

A significant constraint in the development of effective treatments is the blood-brain barrier (BBB), as it greatly limits the access of therapeutic drugs targeting amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation and neuroinflammation. Nanobodies, single-domain antibody fragments derived from camelids, have emerged as versatile tools with unique properties such as small size, high stability and the ability to penetrate the BBB. Engineered formats allow for specific targeting of Aβ and tau, receptor-mediated transcytosis, and conjugation with therapeutic or diagnostic substances. Preclinical studies show that nanobody-based strategies can reduce pathological burden, attenuate neuroinflammation and improve cognitive outcomes in AD models. Manufacturing scale-up, long-term safety and regulatory validation are among the remaining challenges, yet nanobody engineering represents a viable path to disease-modifying medicines. Innovative approaches, including artificial intelligence-driven design, i.e. 4-1BB agonist nanobodies, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-facilitated diversification of nanobody libraries - such as targeted complementarity-determining region 3 mutagenesis followed by functional screening against disease-relevant tau or Aβ conformers - alongside half-life extension strategies, are commencing to surmount these obstacles and enhance the potential of nanobody platforms to develop into clinically viable disease-modifying therapies."}, "authors": [{"id": "2406016072", "name": "Thee Jootar"}, {"id": "1786349", "name": "S.

It aimed to synthesize evidence on orthographic anomalies, error patterns, and variation in English to Arabic and Arabic to English transliteration across social media, shop names, and linguistic landscapes. The fourteen studies share a unified methodological framework and provide quantitative data (percentages, frequencies, and error rates) that allow for statistical aggregation. The fourteen studies were categorized into 3 clusters: Shop names and linguistic landscapes, personal names, borrowed nouns, and ai generated transliteration. Results of the SR/MA revealed consistent patterns of inaccuracy and variation across human Arabic–English transliteration. In public signage, recurrent issues include vowel omission, inconsistent representation of consonants with no direct English equivalents, semantic and syntactic anomalies in compound names, and wide divergence from standard spellings. Personal names show similarly unstable patterns, with multiple transliterations for the same name, inconsistent rendering of the glottal stop and pharyngeal fricatives, variable spelling of the definite article /al /, and frequent gemination errors. Borrowed English nouns display phonological adaptation patterns shaped by Arabic orthography, especially in the representation of /g/ and other non native phonemes by Artificial Intelligence. Meta analytic pooling across studies shows high overall error rates, cross context variation, and tendencies toward under representation of vowels and over regularization of consonants. Subgroup analyses indicate that transliteration accuracy varies by domain, with signage showing the highest error density and personal names the greatest internal variability. Together, the findings demonstrate that human transliteration is shaped by sociolinguistic preference, orthographic habit, and contextual constraints rather than by standardized rules, establishing a coherent empirical profile of real world Arabic–English transliteration behavior. These results offer the first coherent map of human transliteration behavior and lay the groundwork for future research."}, "authors": [{"id": "2314612917", "name": "Reima Al-Jarf"}], "fields_of_study": null}

We understand this as details constraining the set of plausible algorithms, and their implementations, such that only `brain-like'algorithms are learned. In particular, each biological detail breaks a symmetry in connectionist models (scale, rotation, permutation) leading to interpretable single-neuron responses that are meaningfully characteristic of particular algorithms.

The state-of-the-art IAA methods, despite their significant advancements, typically rely heavily on time-consuming and labor-intensive human annotation of aesthetic scores. Furthermore, they are subject to the generalization challenge, which is highly desired in real-world applications. Motivated by this, zero-shot image aesthetics assessment (ZIAA) is investigated to achieve robust model generalization without relying on manual aesthetic annotations, which remains largely underexplored. Specifically, a novel aesthetic prompt learning framework for ZIAA, dubbed AesPrompt, is presented in this paper. The key insight of AesPrompt is to emulate the human aesthetic perception process for learning aesthetic-oriented prompts in a multi-granularity manner. First, we first develop a new pseudo aesthetic distribution generation paradigm based on multi-LLM ensemble. Then, external knowledge of multi-granularity prompts encompassing image themes, emotions, and aesthetics is acquired. Through learning the multi-granularity aesthetic-oriented prompts, the proposed method achieves better generalization and interpretability. Extensive experiments on five IAA benchmarks demonstrate that AesPrompt consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ZIAA methods across diverse-sourced images, covering natural images, artistic images, and artificial intelligence-generated images."}, "authors": [{"id": "2261749850", "name": "Xiangfei Sheng"}, {"id": "2279316434", "name": "Leida Li"}, {"id": "2158171518", "name": "Pengfei Chen"}, {"id": "2376287954", "name": "Li Cai"}, {"id": "2266212073", "name": "Giuseppe Valenzise"}], "fields_of_study": null}
