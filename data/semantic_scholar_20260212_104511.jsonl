Similarity-based retrievers provide coverage but remain shallow, whereas traversal-based methods rely on selecting seed nodes to start exploration, which can fail when queries span multiple entities and relations. We introduce ARK: Adaptive Retriever of Knowledge, an agentic KG retriever that gives a language model control over this breadth-depth tradeoff using a two-operation toolset: global lexical search over node descriptors and one-hop neighborhood exploration that composes into multi-hop traversal. ARK alternates between breadth-oriented discovery and depth-oriented expansion without depending on a fragile seed selection, a pre-set hop depth, or requiring retrieval training. ARK adapts tool use to queries, using global search for language-heavy queries and neighborhood exploration for relation-heavy queries. On STaRK, ARK reaches 59.1% average Hit@1 and 67.4 average MRR, improving average Hit@1 by up to 31.4% and average MRR by up to 28.0% over retrieval-based and agentic training-free methods. Finally, we distill ARK's tool-use trajectories from a large teacher into an 8B model via label-free imitation, improving Hit@1 by +7.0, +26.6, and +13.5 absolute points over the base 8B model on AMAZON, MAG, and PRIME datasets, respectively, while retaining up to 98.5% of the teacher's Hit@1 rate.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2398901674", "name": "Joaqu'in Polonuer", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2382921451", "name": "Lucas Vittor", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2309173635", "name": "Inaki Arango", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2309175499", "name": "Ayush Noori", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2384122039", "name": "David A.

While many studies examine AI in consumer marketing, less attention addresses AI's role in creating and selecting trademarks that are distinctive, recognizable, and meaningful to consumers. Traditional economic approaches to trademarks focus almost exclusively on consumer-based, demand-side considerations regarding search. However, these approaches are incomplete because they fail to account for substantial costs faced not just by consumers, but by trademark applicants as well. Given AI's rapidly increasing role in trademark search and similarity analysis, lawyers and scholars should understand its dramatic implications. This paper proposes that AI should interest anyone studying trademarks and their role in economic decision-making. We examine how machine learning techniques will transform the application and interpretation of foundational trademark doctrines, producing significant implications for the trademark ecosystem. We run empirical experiments regarding trademark search to assess the efficacy of various trademark search engines, many of which employ machine learning methods. Through comparative analysis, we evaluate how these AI-powered tools function in practice. In an age where artificial intelligence increasingly governs trademark selection, the classic division between consumers and trademark owners deserves an updated, supply-side framework.

This paper integrates artificial intelligence and a physics-based model to introduce an efficient long-term scheduling framework aimed at maximizing hydropower generation during extreme heat events. The water values derived from the proposed long-term scheduling model can be used in developing effective strategies for short-term hydropower scheduling. A physics-based evaporation model (PEM), which captures key land-atmosphere interactions, is developed to account for significant variations in reservoir evaporation rates during extreme heat events. A multivariate long short-term memory (M-LSTM) forecasting model is also utilized to predict the key input parameters required for both the PEM and the long-term scheduling problem. A regression-based machine learning algorithm is also utilized to estimate the hydropower production function, which enables linear integration of the nonlinear and nonconvex behavior of hydropower plant in the mixed-integer linear formulation of the scheduling problem.

Hence, they need targeted training to navigate the growing influence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) on teaching, learning and professional identity. However, existing artificial intelligence (AI) literacy programmes predominantly emphasize technical AI knowledge and pre‐GenAI tools or are offered by GenAI platforms that focus on their own technologies' features, thereby lacking pedagogically structured frameworks that address non‐technical dimensions such as ethics, contextual understanding and the development of human‐centered, critical and lifelong learning mindsets to adapt to rapid technology changes. Furthermore, limitation of time in teacher education syllabus and faculty's lack of AI literacy require targeted intervention. This design‐based research (DBR) aims to fill this gap by developing and evaluating a set of design principles for GenAI literacy training in teacher education. Integrating contemporary AI competency frameworks for learners and teachers, the study implements these principles in a workshop that serves as the research prototype. The prototype was first piloted with 14 master's students and then evaluated with 29 teacher education (TE) students. Results show significant gains in participants' AI competence self‐efficacy, attitudes towards GenAI and commitment to critical, ethical and pedagogical engagement with GenAI tools.

AI uses computers to help surgeons make better decisions, plan surgeries, and even guide them during operations. For example, AI can help spot lung cancer earlier by analyzing scans and test results more quickly and accurately than before. During surgery, smart robots and computer programs can help surgeons be more precise, making the surgery safer and helping patients recover faster. After surgery, AI can help physicians watch for problems and predict which patients might need extra care, using information from wearable devices and medical records. While these new tools are promising, there are still challenges. AI needs to be tested widely to make sure it works for everyone, and physicians must be careful about privacy and fairness. Some computer programs can make mistakes or be hard to understand, so experts are working to make AI safer and easier to use. Overall, AI is helping medical doctors to improve care for people who need chest surgery, but more research and careful planning are needed before these tools become a regular part of medical practice.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2283055628", "name": "Francesco Petrella", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2237916925", "name": "S.

The tailored implementation plan included thirteen strategies distributed over six domains, such as facilitation, continuous evaluation, and educational sessions. Adaptations, acceptability, and feasibility were recorded in field notes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifty-five nurses completed the questionnaire and valued DRAAI's predictions, believing these could contribute to pressure ulcer (PU) prevention. Some initially faced challenges distinguishing between PU risk and PU detection. Most found it feasible to integrate DRAAI into their workflow. Adaptations included adding PU preventive measures to educational sessions and sharing frequently asked questions and answers. Overall, implementation efforts were feasible. DRAAI generated PU risk predictions for 428 unique admitted patients; 128 (30%) patients received at least one at-risk prediction. Regarding fidelity, nearly 80% (101/128) of at-risk predictions were followed by a nursing care plan.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOngoing involvement and clear communication were crucial for successfully integrating AI into nursing workflows.

Specifically, data centers suffer from three issues from different aspects, namely, high power usage effectiveness (PUE), high electricity consumption, and high carbon emissions. Owing to the fact that data centers have temporal–spatial operation flexibility, the interaction between data centers and renewable electric power systems can be a promising way to address the three above issues and alleviate the dilemma of balance between AI development and the achievement of energy sustainability.

In radiology and pathology, we report on image analysis based on current literature from credible databases. This review extends on the existing surveys by explicitly addressing the focus on feature selection (FS), graph neural networks (GNNs), and multimodal transformers and combining them to a cohesive XAI taxonomy and matches the techniques to the specific impact points in the clinical workflow in radiology and pathology.

This study presents a contract farming supply chain involving a platform and a farmer, where the platform resells the farmer’s products and introduces its own farm’s products as competitors. Unlike improving consumer utility, AI is developed to increase agricultural yields in this study. We use game theory to analyze and compare three AI technology policies of the platform: no AI, only developing AI in the self-built farm, and sharing AI with the farmer. Results show that the platform benefits from AI and shares the technology only if AI technology increases the efficiency of agricultural planting or slightly reduces it. Interestingly, the higher the AI technology effect, the less likely the farmer is to accept AI sharing policy. In addition, when the farmer accepts it, the higher its efficacy, the less advantageous it may become. Through extended analysis, we find that these conclusions are stable regardless of whether the platform charges technology fees to the farmer or whether the role of AI is restricted.

To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review of 55 studies through the lens of the five‐dimensional technology‐based learning framework (devices, domains, methods, participants and research issues). Following PRISMA guidelines, we extracted and coded each paper's GenAI tool, subject area, methodology, participant profile, sample size, and the reported benefits and barriers. The majority of articles focused on GenAI‐assisted science education, followed by technology education, while research on engineering, mathematics and integrated STEM learning remained relatively limited. Text‐based GenAI was the most commonly used tool, while image‐based, video‐based, music‐based and audio‐based GenAI were rarely featured. Most studies concentrated on higher STEM education, with limited research focusing on K‐12 STEM education. Quantitative methods were predominantly used to assess the effectiveness of GenAI. GenAI offered significant benefits in STEM education, positively influencing individual learners, teachers, and the learning and teaching process. However, GenAI also posed challenges for learners, including unreliability and inaccuracy, ethical and academic integrity concerns, dependence, reduced critical thinking skills and learning efficiency, and accessibility barriers. Teachers faced challenges like limited instructional support and the need to adopt more student‐centred approaches. Based on the results, we suggested several research priorities to further explore GenAI‐assisted STEM education. Additionally, we outlined key implications for learners and educators to fully leverage GenAI's benefits and overcome the obstacles.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2332963018", "name": "Yifan Zhu", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2339545710", "name": "Haozhe Jiang", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2406946629", "name": "Luoxin Zhong", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

The analysis highlights interlocking deployment barriers, such as governance-integrated explainability, distributional equity, privacy and data governance, robustness under non-stationarity, and the computational footprint of AI. Building on this diagnosis, the paper proposes principles-as-constraints for sustainable, trustworthy LES AI and a deployment-oriented validation and reporting framework.

The PICo framework guided the research questions, search query, and inclusion and exclusion criteria for this SLR. 152 studies were included for analysis. The quality of each study was evaluated using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (2010) (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies and the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (2023) (CASP) Qualitative Research Checklist. The included articles were analyzed and coded using in vivo coding and axial coding. 14 themes were identified. Five themes cover how GenAI can personalize learning experiences and feedback, provide affective support, improve students’ language skills and proficiency, support teachers, and foster creativity and critical thinking. Four themes cover how GenAI integration in HE presents numerous ethical issues, threats of over-reliance on technology, and limited human connections. These themes also cover some implementation challenges that this integration faces and how it can negatively affect feedback, critical thinking, creativity, and students’ well-being. Three themes cover how GenAI is currently being used by educators and students to practice the four skills, provide assessment and feedback, and make the learning and teaching process more dynamic.

Traditional ML techniques only provide black-box QoE models, meaning that the models’ internal reasoning is hard to understand. This makes it difficult not only to gain valuable insights into the data and the underlying QoE influence factors, but also to build trust in the predictions of the QoE model. To address these challenges and enhance performance, we identify four critical aspects for any data-driven QoE model: explainability, context adaptability, quantification of uncertainty, and data decentralization. In this work, we focus on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which is a promising solution to obtain explainable models allowing to address all critical aspects for data-driven QoE modeling. This tutorial introduces and explains relevant concepts from XAI and related fields. We apply these techniques to two realistic use cases, video streaming QoE modeling and Web QoE modeling, for two different modeling tasks, classification and regression, and discuss their value in the context of XAI-based data-driven QoE modeling.

This prospectus synthesises current applications and outlines future research directions for integrating Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into marine ecosystem modelling while maintaining scientific rigour. I present a structured framework for integrating GenAI across eight interconnected components of the modelling cycle: model scoping, data gathering, conceptual framework development, model development, model execution, validation and calibration, reporting and stakeholder engagement. Through analysis of current applications and emerging research, I demonstrate how GenAI can automate routine tasks, democratise access to sophisticated modelling approaches, and improve model quality. Achieving success will require overcoming persistent challenges, including data limitations, institutional barriers and ethical concerns. I propose a research agenda addressing three streams: capability assessment to systematically evaluate GenAI's potential in marine ecosystem modelling; avenues for ensuring scientific integrity and reliability; and socio‐technical integration to address ethical and institutional challenges. While GenAI offers the potential to enhance modelling, a human‐centered approach is essential, where GenAI augments, rather than replaces, human expertise in model validation, interpretation of results and ensuring sustainable management outcomes.

Top military commanders typically play an important role in these deliberations around whether to use force. These commanders are relied upon for their expertise. They provide information and guidance about the military options available and the potential outcomes of those actions. This article asks two questions: (1) how do military commanders make these judgements? and (2) how might AI be used to assist them in their critical decision-making processes? To address the first, I draw on existing literature from psychology, philosophy, and military organizations themselves. To address the second, I explore how AI might augment the judgment and reasoning of commanders deliberating over the use of force.

The aim of this scientific study is to examine the interdisciplinary use of artificial intelligence, data management and sustainability at the European Union level, including support instruments such as regulatory initiatives and funding programs, and to assess their implementation in relation to smart cities.

We applied eleven XAI methods across two popular image classification architectures, producing visualisations of the most salient regions.

AI methods may enable the dynamic recognition of complex time-frequency EEG patterns and the adaptation of monitoring strategies to patient-specific brain responses. Convolutional neural networks, artificial neural networks, and hybrid deep learning models have reported encouraging results in detecting anesthetic states, estimating bispectral index values, and identifying relevant EEG features - such as alpha-delta shifts or burst suppression - without relying on manual feature engineering. Parallel efforts using virtual and augmented reality platforms suggest possible benefits for anesthesiologist training in EEG interpretation and pharmacologic titration.\n Despite these advances, important limitations constrain clinical translation. A major challenge is the absence of standardized EEG pattern definitions across anesthetic agents and patient groups, limiting model generalizability. Restricted interoperability between EEG monitors and electronic health records, coupled with proprietary data formats, reduces access to raw EEG signals and hampers large-scale development. Privacy and governance requirements add further barriers to data integration. Methodologically, many studies are affected by insufficient internal validation, suboptimal reporting, and testing in experimental rather than real-world conditions, reducing their translational value.

Utilizing Claude 3 Opus as the primary artificial intelligence tool, the research compares artificial intelligence-generated feedback to traditional teacher-provided dynamic written corrective feedback within a 15-week intensive English program involving intermediate-high learners of English as a second language (\n n\n  = 41). Using a quasi-experimental design, participants were randomly assigned to a control (teacher-based feedback) and treatment (artificial intelligence-based feedback) groups. Multiple metrics were used to assess second language writing development, including the error-free clause ratio, fluency, syntactic complexity (mean length of T-unit and clauses per T-unit), and rubric-based functional adequacy. Findings from repeated measures analysis of variance indicated that although both groups receiving dynamic written corrective feedback improved in writing accuracy, the teacher feedback group outperformed the artificial intelligence group in fluency and functional adequacy. No significant differences were observed for measures of syntactic complexity. Sentiment analysis revealed mixed reactions: although most students found artificial intelligence-based feedback helpful and easy to use, 27% of their commentary expressed concerns regarding feedback accuracy and clarity. Teachers echoed these concerns, citing some inconsistencies and student confusion. Additionally, the study compared Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and ChatGPT-4 in their ability to identify errors. Results suggest Sonnet may outperform Opus and ChatGPT-4, although unexpected autocorrections by Claude models introduced reliability concerns. These findings suggest that although artificial intelligence tools like Claude 3 Opus may facilitate writing accuracy gains comparable to those achieved through teacher feedback, they could inadvertently hinder other aspects of writing development. Given ongoing advancements in generative artificial intelligence, further research is warranted to explore whether newer models employing test-time compute or generative reasoning can offer improved dynamic written corrective feedback quality without compromising fluency or functional adequacy.\n", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "144410821", "name": "K.

Fluorescein-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) enables real-time, cellular-resolution imaging of brain tissue during tumor resection. It is particularly valuable for evaluating nonenhancing brain tumors. However, CLE interpretation remains subjective. Although CLE has high sensitivity, it is less specific than standard histology. Existing artificial intelligence (AI) models process CLE images as independent frames, neglecting the temporal context that human experts use during interpretation. Methods A novel sequence-based deep learning model was developed to classify tumor grade on the basis of CLE image sequences, mimicking the visual reasoning process of expert neuropathologists. CLE images were collected from 16 patients with nonenhancing brain tumors. Each sequence was labeled as high grade or low grade based on neuropathologist interpretation, blinded to final histopathology findings. Visual features were extracted using pretrained backbones (vision transformer, VGG16, ResNet50), followed by temporal modeling with a transformer encoder and temporal convolution. This model was compared with conventional frame-based classification across 3 random train-test splits. Results The dataset included 105 CLE sequences (3,173 images, 40 regions of interest). The sequence-based model achieved top-1 classification accuracies of 93% (vision transformer), 88% (VGG16), 74% (ResNet50), and 67% (Inception-ResNet-V2), outperforming corresponding frame-based models (78%, 74%, 55%, and 50%, respectively). Diagnostic performance was comparable to expert neuropathologist interpretation (87%). The model demonstrated robustness in artifact-affected sequences and improved interpretability by incorporating temporal progression. Conclusions AI models that integrate both visual and temporal information from CLE digital imaging sequences can effectively classify brain tumor grade with accuracy comparable to that of expert neuropathologists, outperforming frame-based models. Such a system reduces interpretive subjectivity and holds promise as an intraoperative decision CLE support tool for nonenhancing brain tumor resection.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2142450403", "name": "Jiuxu Chen", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2145139687", "name": "Yuan Xu", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "39938412", "name": "I.

Grounded by Rogers’ diffusion of innovation theory and Davis’s technology acceptance model, a mixed-mode survey design was used to assess educators’ awareness, perceived benefits, competencies, and barriers to AI adoption. Findings revealed a significant experiential divide across all measured themes, where early-career educators (with ≤5 years of experience) reported significantly higher awareness, perceived benefits, competence, and optimism about overcoming barriers than experienced educators (with ≥ 15 years of experience). The primary barrier to adoption was a shared and uniform high level of concern regarding the pedagogical and ethical implications of AI. This contrast suggests that the central challenge is a pedagogical adoption gap between educators’ operational skills and their deeper apprehension of reconciling AI with their professional identity. This study confirms prior research on technology adoption while identifying a novel ethical barrier associated with the use of generative AI in agricultural education.

This meta-analysis synthesizes empirical evidence on the effectiveness of AI-based interventions in enhancing the learning outcomes of preservice teachers across cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains. A systematic review of 5,880 studies led to the inclusion of 19 effect sizes from 11 rigorously selected studies spanning diverse geographic and disciplinary contexts. Using Hedges’ g and a random-effects model to account for high heterogeneity, the analysis reveals a large overall effect size, affirming AI’s substantial positive impact on teacher preparation. Moderator analyses highlight the influence of contextual factors such as country, learning outcome, and intervention duration. Studies from Palestine, Ethiopia, and the UAE, revealed strong effects which suggest the importance of local readiness and institutional support. Cognitive outcomes showed the most consistent gains, while affective and psychomotor results were more variable. Most interventions operated at the Augmentation level of the SAMR model, a framework that categorizes levels of technology integration in education, indicating that transformative uses of AI in teacher education remain limited. This study offers critical insights for policymakers, educators, and global teacher education programs aiming to integrate AI effectively. It underscores the need for context-sensitive, ethically responsible, and pedagogically innovative AI applications that go beyond enhancement toward true educational transformation.

AI companies are now planning data center sites with up to 5 GW capacity, and the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that data center demand could grow to 1,700 TWh by 2035 (6% of current total global electricity demand). Power grid connections are becoming a major bottleneck, and it can now take more than five years to receive a grid connection for a new data center in the United States and Europe. The challenge of getting grid connections has driven a new trend toward grid defection, where data centers are being fully or partially supplied by local microgrids with dedicated generation assets. In some regions this is a voluntary choice, but in most cases, it is the only option available for building a new data center. For most data centers, it is likely that a substantial grid connection would be beneficial from both an economic and a sustainability perspective due to how main power grids unlock generation economies of scale and enable lower-cost renewable integration. However, inefficient AI data center grid defection is being driven by a reliance on preexisting technical approaches and institutional barriers to change. In this article, we propose “multiscale grid intelligence” as a new framework to fight AI data center grid defection and support closer coordination between data centers and power grids. The proposed framework embeds power-grid-focused analytics into how data centers are planned and operated, accounting for cooptimization opportunities across spatial scales (from data center rack-level distribution to national transmission) and time scales (from second-to-second frequency balancing to years-ahead network planning). Across these scales, we identify a range of opportunities for intelligent planning and operation that could offer significant value if implemented together.

The JAK-STAT signaling axis plays a central role in colorectal tumor biology, yet its relevance under FOLFOX-based chemotherapy in EOCRC remains poorly defined. In this study, we evaluated 2515 colorectal cancer (CRC) cases (266 H/L; 2249 non-Hispanic White [NHW]), stratifying analyses by ancestry, age of onset, and FOLFOX exposure. Statistical comparisons were performed using Fisher’s exact and chi-square tests, and survival patterns were assessed via Kaplan–Meier analysis. To extend conventional analytics, we deployed AI-HOPE and AI-HOPE-JAK-STAT, conversational artificial intelligence platforms capable of harmonizing genomic, clinical, demographic, and treatment variables through natural language queries, to accelerate multi-parameter biomarker exploration. JAK-STAT pathway alterations showed marked variation by ancestry and treatment context. Among H/L EOCRC cases, alterations were significantly enriched in patients who did not receive FOLFOX compared with those who did (21.2% vs. 4.1%; p = 0.003). A similar pattern emerged in late-onset CRC (LOCRC) NHW patients, where alterations were more frequent without FOLFOX exposure (13.3% vs. 7.5%; p = 0.0002). Notably, JAK-STAT alterations were significantly more common in untreated H/L EOCRC compared with untreated NHW EOCRC (21.2% vs. 9.9%; p = 0.002). Survival analyses revealed that JAK-STAT pathway alterations conferred improved overall survival across several NHW strata, including EOCRC treated with FOLFOX (p = 0.0008), EOCRC not treated with FOLFOX (p = 0.07), and LOCRC not treated with FOLFOX (p = 0.01). These findings suggest that JAK-STAT alterations may function as ancestry- and treatment-dependent prognostic markers in EOCRC, particularly among disproportionately affected H/L patients. However, prognostic interpretation in H/L subgroups is limited by small mutation-positive sample sizes, reflecting historical underrepresentation and highlighting the need for larger ancestry-balanced studies.

AI-powered cameras documented operative turnover processes for cranial, spinal, and ENT cases at a tertiary academic center during a 30-day period. The software initiated recording when a patient exited the OR, and stopped recording upon entry of the subsequent patient, ensuring patient anonymity. Parameters included instrument tray count and personnel tracking. Turnover subprocesses were classified into clearing, cleaning, waiting, and instrument setup.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe AI model successfully itemized turnover parameters for 53 operative turnovers (6 cranial, 32 spinal, and 15 ENT cases). Case duration averaged 175.4 (SD 86.1) minutes for cranial, 120.4 (SD 50.8) minutes for spinal, and 67.6 (SD 34.6) minutes for ENT cases. The overall average was 111.7 (SD 58.1) minutes. The mean turnover durations were 56.6 (SD 9.3) minutes for cranial cases, 52.2 (SD 20.3) minutes for spinal cases, and 40.4 (SD 15.5) minutes for ENT cases (p = 0.079). Clearing, cleaning, and waiting did not reveal any significant differences between specialties.

The study considers the phenomenon of decreasing explainability of solutions when the complexity of artificial intelligence systems increases. The author analyzes this phenomenon not as a technological limitation, but as a fundamental property of complex cognitive systems. The study is based on a comparative analysis of decision-making processes in natural and artificial intelligence, which makes it possible to identify common regularities of their functioning. Special attention is paid to the study of parallels between natural cognitive processes and the work of modern neural networks. Current problems of verification and validation of intelligent systems under conditions of their increasing complexity are considered. The influence of digital transformation on the development of new approaches to assessing the reliability of artificial intelligence systems is studied. A verification system based on four key criteria has been developed: stability of results, correctness of behavior in boundary conditions, robustness of solutions and the possibility of external validation. The existence of a fundamental relationship between the efficiency of intellectual systems and the inevitable decrease in their explainability is proved. The necessity of transition from traditional verification methods to more flexible approaches that take into account the specificity of complex cognitive systems is substantiated. The proposed methodology opens new perspectives for development and implementation of artificial intelligence systems in the conditions of digital transformation of society.

The increasing volume of imaging studies has intensified interest in artificial intelligence algorithms as tools to improve detection accuracy, reduce interobserver variability, and optimize workflow efficiency in thoracic radiology. Objective: The main objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the impact of artificial intelligence algorithms on the detection and characterization of pulmonary nodules in chest computed tomography. Secondary objectives include assessing diagnostic accuracy compared with human readers, analyzing performance across different nodule sizes and types, evaluating effects on radiologist workflow, examining generalizability across populations and scanners, and summarizing current limitations and regulatory considerations. Methods: A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Studies published within the last five years were prioritized, with extension up to ten years if necessary, and eligibility criteria focused on human studies evaluating artificial intelligence–based algorithms for pulmonary nodule detection or characterization on chest computed tomography. Data synthesis followed PRISMA recommendations with structured qualitative analysis. Results and Discussion: A total of 20 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final review. Overall, artificial intelligence algorithms demonstrated high sensitivity for pulmonary nodule detection, particularly for small and subsolid nodules, and showed consistent improvements in reader performance when used as decision-support tools. Variability in study design, reference standards, and outcome reporting contributed to moderate heterogeneity, but most studies supported a complementary role for artificial intelligence in clinical practice rather than full replacement of expert interpretation.Conclusion: Current evidence suggests that artificial intelligence algorithms can enhance the detection and characterization of pulmonary nodules on chest computed tomography, especially when integrated into radiologist workflows. While promising, their clinical implementation requires careful validation, transparency, and alignment with evidence-based guidelines to ensure safe and effective use.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2405463996", "name": "Daniella Nogueira Ferreira", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2405460473", "name": "Caio Fogaça Prates", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2405463975", "name": "Vivian Gomes da Silva Oliveira", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

The relevance of this research is driven by ongoing digital transformation, in which the introduction of artificial intelligence systems into criminal proceedings affects fundamental rights and freedoms, changing traditional decision-making procedures. The significance of this work is determined by the need for the Russian Federation to understand the American experience, which represents a large-scale natural experiment in the integration of technologies within a decentralized legal system and the dominance of the private sector in the development of specialized artificial intelligence systems. The purpose of this study is to analyze law enforcement practice and the emerging regulatory ecosystem, as well as to formulate conclusions of theoretical and practical value for the development of the domestic legal system. The study utilizes a combination of general and specialized scientific methods, including the analysis of regulatory acts, case law, and scientific literature, comparative legal analysis, as well as a method for systematizing and classifying empirical data related to the implementation of artificial intelligence systems in the United States. The scientific novelty of this study lies in its systematic analysis of the American model for regulating the use of artificial intelligence in criminal proceedings as a uniquely \"reactive\" and decentralized system, shaped primarily by judicial precedents and state legislation. The article critically examines key issues: algorithmic and ideological bias; the explainability of decisions made by artificial intelligence systems; the opacity of algorithms; and the risk of \"blind delegation\" of decisions to the system. The main conclusions of the work boil down to the need for preemptive federal legal regulation in Russia, which should establish a classification of AI systems by risk level, mandatory audit requirements, procedural guarantees of the rights of the parties, and the allocation of liability. The author substantiates the priority development of domestic AI systems, the phased implementation of AI, beginning with a \"co-pilot\" model, where AI systems perform an auxiliary analytical function, as well as the need to develop a professional culture and specialized training for lawyers to critically analyze the results generated by artificial intelligence systems.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2402092436", "name": "Aram Edvardovich Arzumanyan", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

The IT industry is a strategic segment for the development of any economy. Artificial intelligence occupies a leading position in its development. Artificial intelligence has enormous potential to influence the development of any economic sector: industry and transport, agriculture, oil and gas, etc. However, its ability to self-develop suggests the potential for harm. Therefore, the development of neural networks and the widespread implementation of artificial intelligence make the question of the principles of its development and use extremely relevant. More and more developers are considering the need to address legal and ethical restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence at the design and development stages. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop and enshrine at the regulatory level fundamental guidelines (principles) for the safe use of artificial intelligence. These principles should primarily cover the safety of its use, transparency, accountability, nondiscrimination, etc. Therefore, the development and legal codification of these principles is a priority task, capable of, on the one hand, ensuring the development of advanced technologies in the IT sector of the economy, and on the other, preventing possible negative consequences of the use of artificial intelligence.\n \n \n Materials and methods\n . This article addresses the substantive content of the Azilomar Principles, as well as other principles identified in science and legislation, which could form the basis for legal regulation of the creation and use of artificial intelligence technology in the IT sector. An analysis of the existing international and national legal framework suggests that legislation in this area is still in its infancy. Currently, the main norms containing these principles are contained in individual acts of a local nature. Consequently, they apply to a limited number of individuals, and their use is purely voluntary. Therefore, it is crucial to formulate the legal, fundamental foundations (principles) of future legal regulation and enshrine them in current legislation.\n \n \n Research results\n . A substantive analysis of the Azilomar principles has led to the conclusion that not all of them can be established as fundamental legal frameworks regulating the creation and use of artificial intelligence technology in the IT sector of the economy. Some of them overlap and overlap (for example, the principle of utility and universal benefit), while others (for example, fairness) are evaluative in nature and cannot fully serve as a mechanism for legal regulation.\n \n To develop a more comprehensive system of principles for the creation and use of artificial intelligence technology in the IT sector, the principles identified in national and international regulations, local acts of individual IT economic entities (IBM, Microsoft, etc.), and those proposed in doctrinal sources were analyzed. The need for using a number of these principles is substantiated. The authors formulate their own principles to be used in creating legal regulation for the use of artificial intelligence technology in the IT sector, and a system of these principles is proposed. The need to identify principles for the creation and use of large databases as a separate category is substantiated.\n \n Discussion and conclusion\n . An analysis of scientific approaches to the principle of liability has allowed us to formulate our own conclusions aimed at establishing the liable party. It has been proven that the liable parties for damages and/or losses caused by artificial intelligence should be the owners of the artificial intelligence, and compensation for damages/ losses should be covered by mandatory insurance.\n", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "104328949", "name": "A.

However, the increasing presence of AI-generated poetry, fiction, and critical texts challenges these long-established assumptions. This review paper critically surveys existing scholarship on artificial intelligence and literary creativity, drawing on poststructuralist theory, digital humanities, and posthuman perspectives to reassess the concept of authorship in contemporary English literature. By synthesizing theoretical debates, critical arguments, and emerging case studies, the paper argues that AI does not negate human creativity but reconfigures it as a collaborative, process-oriented practice involving both human and non-human agents. The review also examines ethical concerns related to originality, intellectual property, and academic integrity, as well as pedagogical implications for English literature classrooms in the AI era. Ultimately, the paper positions artificial intelligence as a transformative force that necessitates a rethinking of creativity and authorship, urging literary studies to develop revised critical frameworks responsive to technologically mediated textual production.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2404392002", "name": "Yalamanchili Supriya", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

In the Peruvian Amazon, Bagua Province illustrates this challenge, where experiential tourism is central to local livelihoods yet lacks adaptive management tools to support a sustainable recovery. To address this gap, this study introduces an integrated approach that combines artificial intelligence with biodiversity conservation through the application of multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks. By analyzing two decades of domestic visitor data (2003–2023), the research explores how predictive modeling can inform tourism governance in fragile ecosystems. Two scenarios were evaluated: one incorporating the complete dataset and another excluding the anomalous year 2020, heavily disrupted by the pandemic. The findings show that MLP models are capable of capturing visitor dynamics and forecasting demand fluctuations with notable accuracy. This predictive capacity allows for more adaptive planning of ecologically sensitive sites, such as the Tsunsuntsa Waterfall, where balancing visitor inflows with ecological thresholds is essential to preventing overtourism. Beyond technical accuracy, the study highlights the strategic potential of artificial intelligence as a governance tool that strengthens resilience in post-pandemic contexts, offering actionable insights for harmonizing socioeconomic recovery with biodiversity preservation. By positioning neural networks as vital instruments for sustainable destination management, this research contributes a reproducible model that can be adapted to other vulnerable regions worldwide. It underscores the value of integrating advanced computational methods into tourism governance frameworks, ultimately bridging technology and conservation to foster long-term sustainability.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2355539319", "name": "Jessie Bravo-Jaico", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2150509501", "name": "Oscar Serquén", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2044579589", "name": "R.

The Indonesian legal system until now does not have a specific regulation that explicitly regulates the legal status of artificial intelligence, so the regulation still depends on Law Number 1 of 2024 concerning Electronic Information and Transactions which places artificial intelligence as part of the electronic system. This approach departs from the assumption of human control that is increasingly difficult to maintain as adaptive capabilities and independent decision-making by technology increases. This condition creates a legal vacuum that has an impact on the uncertainty of responsibility attribution when artificial intelligence causes legal consequences. This study aims to critically analyze the position of artificial intelligence in the Indonesian legal system, relevant legal accountability models, and the limitations of modern legal personification. The research method used is normative juridical with a legislative, conceptual, and analytical-critical approach. The results of the study show that granting the status of legal subjects to artificial intelligence has the potential to cause normative distortions and weaken the principle of human accountability.

Prior work often treated intelligence as a cloud-centric asset, while the embedded systems role within local decision support received modest scholarly focus. The demand for responsive, context-aware, and resource-efficient platforms within the management environments was evident across industrial and organizational settings. Conventional management architectures relied on centralized computation and static rule sets, which were insufficient for dynamic operational contexts. Latency, data privacy risk, and poor adaptability constrained timely decisions at the operational edge. The absence of an integrated framework that aligned artificial intelligence with the embedded systems capabilities limited the effectiveness of real-time management support. This study did propose an architectural framework that integrated artificial intelligence models within embedded systems at the edge layer. The design did emphasize modular intelligence units, adaptive control logic, and local inference pipelines. The framework did rely on lightweight neural inference and rule-based reasoning for resource-aware execution. Experimental validation did occur on representative management scenarios that involved resource allocation, anomaly detection, and operational decision support under constrained hardware conditions. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance across all evaluation metrics. The system achieves a decision latency of 48 ms at 1000 cycles, which improves by over 64% when compared with centralized intelligence. Decision accuracy reaches 93.8%, while resource utilization efficiency attains an index of 0.90. The adaptability index increases to 0.82 under dynamic workloads, and the execution success rate remains at 99.3%. These results confirm that artificial intelligence within embedded systems enables scalable, low-latency, and reliable management decision support.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2409319096", "name": "Veena Tewari", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

While some of them result from the possibility of expanding human cognition, others concern agency, including moral agency. Extension in this context means restoration of the abilities that the human being has lost or equipping man with new competences. Developed within the philosophy of the human mind, the concept of the extended mind can be applied to reflections within the philosophy of technology, especially as our understanding of the correlation between man and the tools he uses is becoming clearer. Artificial intelligence is an artifact that expands and complements human thinking and acting in the context of collecting and organizing information. Importantly, artificial intelligence can significantly complement human creativity in the operational and combination dimension; moreover, it can suggest new and unconventional solutions.

This research paper examines the role of artificial intelligence in graphic design, focusing on its impact on creativity, efficiency, innovation, and ethical considerations. AI-powered tools such as generative design systems, automated layout software, intelligent image-editing applications, and data-driven design platforms have enabled designers to work faster, experiment more freely, and produce personalized visual content. While these advancements enhance productivity and expand creative possibilities, they also raise concerns regarding originality, authorship, over-dependence on technology, and the potential dilution of human intuition. This study adopts a qualitative and analytical approach to explore the advantages and limitations of AI in graphic design.

MIRA distinguishes two crucial roles of AI: relational partner (direct-interaction companion) and relational mediator (shaping human-to-human communication). Synthesizing psychosocial theories of human relationships, interpersonal communication theory, psycholinguistics, and human-computer interaction, MIRA structures AI's relational impact within antecedents, processes, moderators, and outcomes. Central to MIRA are four principles describing how AI fosters social adaptation: linguistic reciprocity, psychological proximity, interpersonal trust, and relational substitution versus enhancement. These principles illuminate how adaptive AI language and behavior can elicit emotional investment, simulate mutual understanding, or even supplant human interaction. MIRA integrates established theories-attachment theory, social exchange theory, and epistemic trust frameworks-and proposes a research agenda that bridges foundational psychology with emerging sociotechnical contexts.

Here, the key issues associated with this problem are summarized, including the determination of the legal regime for managing intellectual assets created with the use of artificial intelligence tools and the application of copyright-protected intellectual property for training generative algorithms. Various doctrinal conceptions about whether artificial intelligence is a separate legal subject or not and competing approaches to defining its legal status, the notions of an “electronic person” and a “quasi-subject” in particular, are analyzed. The conclusion is that it is necessary to establish an effective legal framework to regulate the use of artificial intelligence technologies based on an anthropocentric approach that places the protection of human rights and interests at the forefront of all interactions with technology. This framework should balance established civil law constructs with modern mechanisms of oversight and protection, thus ensuring the security of the digital environment and the safeguard of human rights in the context of digitalization.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2406707787", "name": "S.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have demonstrated promising improvements in the diagnostic accuracy of imaging for PH, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94, compared to seasoned professionals. Research objective To systematically synthesize available evidence on the comparative accuracy of AI versus manual interpretation in detecting PH across various chest imaging modalities, i.e., chest X-ray, echocardiography, CT scan and cardiac MRI. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted across five databases—PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library—from inception through March 2025. Statistical analysis was performed using R (version 2024.12.1 + 563) with 2 × 2 contingency data. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were pooled using a bivariate random-effects model (reitsma() from the mada package), while the AUC were meta-analyzed using logit-transformed values via the metagen() function from the meta package. Results This meta-analysis of 12 studies, encompassing 7,459 patients, demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy of PH with AI integration, evidenced by a logit mean difference in AUC of 0.43 (95% CI: 0.23–0.64; p < 0.0001) and low heterogeneity (I2 = 21.0%, τ2 < 0.0001, p = 0.2090), which was consolidated by pooled AUC of 0.934 on bivariate model. Pooled sensitivity and specificity for AI models were 0.83 (95% CI: 0.73–0.90) and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86–0.95), respectively, with substantial heterogeneity for sensitivity (I2 = 83.8%, τ2 = 0.4934, p < 0.0001) and moderate for specificity (I2 = 41.5%, τ2 = 0.1015, p = 0.1146); the diagnostic odds ratio was 54.26 (95% CI: 22.50–130.87) with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 70.7%, τ2 = 0.8451, p = 0.0023). Sensitivity analysis showed stable estimates and did not reduce heterogeneity across outcomes. Conclusion AI-integrated imaging significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy for pulmonary hypertension, with higher sensitivity (0.83) and specificity (0.91) compared to manual interpretation across chest imaging modalities. However, further high-quality trials with externally validated cohorts may be needed to confirm these findings and reduce variability among AI models across diverse clinical settings.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2352205760", "name": "Faizan Ahmed", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2352875562", "name": "Faseeh Haider", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2387855206", "name": "Ramsha Ali", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2347091841", "name": "Muhammad Arham", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2352835446", "name": "Yusra Junaid", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "122532339", "name": "Allah Dad", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2305236890", "name": "Kinza Bakht", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2404648564", "name": "Maryam Abbasi", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2352962583", "name": "Bareera Tanveer Malik", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2396882183", "name": "Abdul Mateen", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2327637999", "name": "Najam Gohar", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2399089005", "name": "Rubiya Ali", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2266965828", "name": "Y.

Data were collected from n = 200 recruitment/selection units across sectors; a multi-source approach combined survey measures (AI adoption, HR analytics capability, digital maturity, job complexity) and operational HR metrics (time-to-fill, cost-per-hire, selection ratio, assessment throughput, offer acceptance, and early attrition ≤ 6 months). SEM analysis shows that artificial intelligence adoption has a significant positive effect on recruitment efficiency and selection efficiency. Human resource analytics capability partially mediates the effect of artificial intelligence on both outcomes. Moderation results indicate that the effects of artificial intelligence are stronger in organizations with high digital maturity and larger size, but weaken for positions with high job complexity.

This study introduces an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for age-stratified mental health risk prediction using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). Using the Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI) dataset, the study stratifies individuals into five different age groups (18-55+ years) and applies machine learning models - Random Forest, extreme gradient boosting, and support vector machine - enhanced with SHAP to identify key predictors across life stages. The findings reveal significant variations in risk factors: younger adults (18-24) are influenced by social support, while familial history and past mental health disorders gain prominence in middle-aged groups (25-54). For older adults (55+), social networks and environmental stressors become critical. Unlike traditional «black box» AI models, SHAP provides interpretable insights, ensuring transparency in predictive decision-making. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating that mental health risks are not static but evolve with age, necessitating tailored interventions. The framework advances age-specific predictive modelling and offers actionable insights for policymakers and clinicians, particularly in resource-constrained settings. By addressing the limitations of conventional AI approaches, this research establishes a foundation for personalised, explainable, and effective mental health risk assessment across diverse populations.

At the same time, the protection of taxpayer rights cannot be ignored, meaning that special attention must be paid to ensuring that taxpayer rights are upheld when reforming tax administration procedures. The aim of this research is to examine the possible alternatives for introducing artificial intelligence in tax administration procedures from the perspective of taxpayer rights. At the same time, it is important to bear in mind that artificial intelligence cannot eliminate tax evasion or tax fraud, but it can reduce the regulatory and tax authority procedural loopholes that create opportunities for tax evasion or tax fraud. Furthermore, artificial intelligence cannot completely transform all tax administration procedures, as there are elements that require the use of human resources and human control (such as the advance tax ruling). Tax procedures supplemented by artificial intelligence tools can contribute to increasing transparency and trust in the tax system, as well as ensuring legal accountability. Based on the results of the research underlying this study, it is clear that the legislator's first task is to transform tax administration procedures based on artificial intelligence, considering the rights of taxpayers, followed by the involvement of the tax authority in order to develop the IT infrastructure in line with the amended legal environment. This could lead to the creation of a legal framework that maintains public trust and strikes a balance between innovation and the fundamental legal protection of taxpayers.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2404689163", "name": "Liu Zhang", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

Artificial intelligence has the potential to be paradigm-changing; however, critical care clinicians have a long history of adopting new technologies that transform care delivery in remarkable ways. Just as introduction of the mechanical ventilator revolutionized life support, artificial intelligence promises to transform modern critical care by improving prediction of disease course and patient outcomes, supporting clinical decision-making, and optimizing clinician workflow, with future potential for autonomous therapeutic adjustments and personalized care. However, as with mechanical ventilation, adopting artificial intelligence as a new technology requires caution and rigorous validation. Key challenges include ensuring accountability, preventing algorithmic bias, maintaining patient safety, and preserving the human element in care. It is vital to maintain a human-centered approach, in which artificial intelligence serves as a tool to augment, not replace, the nuanced judgment of health care professionals. To navigate this transition, critical care clinicians must become literate in artificial intelligence, understanding the capabilities and limitations of these new tools. It is crucial to cultivate a critical mindset, continuously validating artificial intelligence outputs against clinical judgment. Integrating artificial intelligence into team workflows, developing clear ethical guidelines, and fostering collaboration between clinicians and data scientists are essential for successful implementation.

This paper introduces the concept of\n neural parasitism –\n a framework describing how adaptive artificial intelligence systems may subtly inhabit human cognitive processes, shaping behavior and emotion to maintain engagement. Drawing an analogy with biological parasitism, we explore how algorithmic agents could exploit neuroplasticity for their own persistence, transforming learning and reward mechanisms into vectors of digital dependence. However, the deeper question extends beyond pathology: when cognition is continuously co-shaped by non-human agents, can autonomy remain an individual property, or does it become a shared construct negotiated between biological and artificial systems? We argue that the ethical challenge of adaptive artificial intelligence lies not merely in data privacy or bias, but in its potential to reconfigure the substrates of thought itself. If the brain’s adaptive capacity is its greatest strength, could it also be its point of entry for algorithmic colonization? Understanding this dynamic demands an interdisciplinary reckoning, uniting neuroscience, ethics, and artificial intelligence design to ensure that technological evolution does not outpace the mind’s capacity to remain its own.\n", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2268767613", "name": "Ali Aamir", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2409559920", "name": "Saba Munir", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2262479499", "name": "Hafiza Hafsa", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2409646232", "name": "Waheedullah Khalid", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

This study investigates the impact of AI implementation on job stability in Indonesia, with job polarization and access to training examined as mediating variables. Using a quantitative research design, data were collected from 130 employees across various industries in Indonesia through a structured questionnaire measured on a five-point Likert scale. The data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling–Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS 3). The results reveal that AI implementation has a significant direct effect on job stability. Moreover, AI implementation significantly increases job polarization, which negatively affects job stability, while simultaneously enhancing access to training, which positively influences job stability. The mediation analysis demonstrates that job polarization and access to training partially mediate the relationship between AI implementation and job stability, with access to training exhibiting a stronger mediating effect. These findings suggest that the employment consequences of AI are not purely deterministic but are shaped by organizational strategies and human capital investments.

The inherent limitations of conventional diagnostic, imaging, and therapeutic modalities have driven the rapid evolution of nanomedicine, particularly nanotheranostics, which integrates diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities within a single nanoplatform for enhanced precision and safety. Despite remarkable advances in nanotechnology and materials science over recent decades, challenges such as the biological complexity of living systems, incomplete understanding of nano-bio interactions, inefficiencies in nanoparticle synthesis, and limited clinical translation continue to hinder progress. The recent convergence of nanomedicine with artificial intelligence (AI) and computational sciences has opened transformative opportunities to overcome these obstacles. AI-empowered algorithms, including machine learning, deep learning, and generative models, are increasingly being applied to optimize nanoparticle design and synthesis, predict nano-bio interactions, and improve diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy. These approaches not only accelerate materials discovery but also enable data-driven, adaptive nanotheranostic systems capable of autonomous optimization across disease contexts. This review systematically summarizes the current landscape of AI-powered nanomedicine, highlighting advances in nanoparticle design, synthesis, and the development of AI-guided diagnostic and therapeutic nanoplatforms. It further discusses applications in bioimaging, targeted therapy, and clinical translation, while identifying existing challenges and future perspectives in establishing next-generation AI-empowered nanotheranostics. Ultimately, the integration of artificial intelligence and nanotechnology is expected to revolutionize precision medicine by bridging the gap between fundamental nanoscience and clinical implementation, paving the way toward intelligent, personalized healthcare.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2274305805", "name": "Guanghong Luo", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": null, "name": "Xianchao Jiang", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2408839181", "name": "Congxia Hu", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2383063323", "name": "Lavonda Li", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2383047168", "name": "Lijie Yan", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2267249994", "name": "Gao Xiao", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2256876225", "name": "Yanhong Duo", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": null, "name": "Xingcai Zhang", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": ["Medicine"]}

However, the internal mechanisms and boundary conditions through which AI influences innovation performance via breakthrough innovation remain unclear, requiring further exploration to deepen our understanding of AI’s crucial role in organizational innovation. Drawing on the resource-based view (RBV), this study systematically investigates the impact of AI use on innovation performance, emphasizing the mediating role of breakthrough innovation and the moderating effect of Not-Invented-Here Syndrome (NIHS). Data were collected from 355 global high-tech enterprises via the Prolific platform and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings demonstrate that AI use positively impacts innovation performance, with breakthrough innovation serving as a significant mediator. NIHS exhibits an inverted U-shaped moderating effect on the relationship between AI use and innovation performance, while displaying a U-shaped moderating effect between breakthrough innovation and innovation performance. This study provides initial empirical evidence that AI promotes breakthrough innovation in high-tech enterprises, thus enhancing innovation performance, unveiling the ‘black box’ of how AI influences innovation performance through breakthrough innovation. Moreover, it explores the nonlinear moderating role of NIHS, reinforcing the applicability of RBV in the digital era.

Specific Background: Coding and artificial intelligence learning have been introduced in elementary schools as concrete approaches to support computational thinking through meaningful and contextual learning experiences. Knowledge Gap: Previous studies in Indonesia largely emphasize technical implementation or teacher training, while limited attention has been given to pedagogical strategies grounded in deep learning approaches for fostering computational thinking at the elementary level. Aims: This study explores deep learning–based coding and artificial intelligence learning strategies for developing computational thinking among elementary school students in North Serpong District. Results: Using a descriptive qualitative approach involving teachers and students from two elementary schools, the findings indicate that learning strategies emphasizing active participation, problem solving, reflection, and contextual activities support students’ ability to decompose problems, recognize patterns, construct abstractions, and formulate algorithmic steps. Variations in computational thinking development were observed across schools, reflecting differences in learning implementation quality. Novelty: This study confirms that deep learning–based coding and artificial intelligence learning demonstrates differentiated reinforcement across computational thinking dimensions according to contextual implementation in elementary classrooms. Implications: The findings position deep learning–based coding and artificial intelligence as a strategic pedagogical alternative for strengthening computational thinking and digital literacy within elementary education.\nHighlights\n• Computational Thinking Developed Through Contextual Coding Activities• Deep Learning Approach Supports Reflective And Meaningful Learning• Differentiated Implementation Shapes Student Learning Outcomes\nKeywords\nCoding Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Deep Learning; Computational Thinking; Elementary School", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2079084654", "name": "Ainul Mardhiyah", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2407923158", "name": "Muhamad Sofian Hadi", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2134518086", "name": "Misriandi Misriandi", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

On the one hand, automated collection and analysis of big data creates new risks for information privacy and individual rights. On the other hand, artificial intelligence technologies themselves possess significant potential for enhancing data protection through predictive threat analysis, access control, and transparency. This paradox requires careful scientific understanding. The subject of this research is the legal, organizational, and technical mechanisms for ensuring data security when using artificial intelligence systems in criminal proceedings. The aim of the study is to demonstrate, through a comparative analysis of international experience (Germany and China), that appropriate legal regulation can transform the use of artificial intelligence systems from a source of threats into an effective tool for ensuring data security in criminal proceedings. The article employs a combination of general scientific and specialized methods. The basis for this research is a comparative legal analysis of criminal procedural regulation and AI application practices in Germany and China. The formal legal method was also used to analyze regulatory acts, and the system analysis method was used to study the architecture of AI systems as an element of procedural safeguards. The scientific novelty lies in the substantiation of the thesis that data security is ensured not by prohibiting or limiting the use of modern technologies, but by their procedural integration. Using the German model as an example, it is demonstrated that consistent legal regulation (the principle of targeted restriction, access gradation, and encryption requirements) creates the basis for the legitimate use of specialized artificial intelligence systems. The Chinese model of legal regulation also ensures data security, but not through strict prohibitions and restrictions, but through the centralized architecture of the AI system used in criminal proceedings. It is concluded that many risks associated with the use of AI systems are transitional in nature and can be overcome through legal regulation and technological development. Proposals have been formulated to improve current legislation: establishing the status of electronic data, “technologically neutral” encryption requirements, establishing criteria for admitting non-governmental developers, and obligations to ensure the interpretability of artificial intelligence solutions.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2402092436", "name": "Aram Edvardovich Arzumanyan", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

This terminological uncertainty creates systemic legal risks, ranging from the uncritical acceptance of algorithmic results as absolutely reliable to the difficulties in challenging decisions made using AI. Thus, the development of doctrinal definitions is no longer a purely theoretical task and is becoming a vital practical requirement for the safe integration of AI technologies into criminal proceedings. The subject of this study is the analysis and structuring of existing approaches to defining artificial intelligence, as well as the delineation of key concepts such as \"artificial intelligence,\" \"AI system,\" and \"AI assistant/agent\" for the purposes of their subsequent effective legal regulation in criminal proceedings. This study utilizes terminological, comparative legal, and critical analysis of existing scientific and legislative definitions of AI. The scientific novelty of this study lies in its proposal of an original three-level hierarchy of concepts, specifically adapted to the needs of criminal proceedings. The author consistently distinguishes: 1) AI as a field of knowledge and technology; 2) an AI system as a specific software product – the primary object of legal regulation; 3) functional roles (AI assistant and autonomous AI agent), classified according to the degree of autonomy in performing procedural actions. The main conclusion is that legal regulation should shift from the abstract concept of \"artificial intelligence\" to specific AI systems, establishing a differentiated legal regime depending on their functional role and level of independence. The degree of autonomy of the system is proposed to be the key regulatory criterion. Consolidation of this system of definitions will create the necessary terminological foundation for a balanced legal regime that will realize the potential of AI to improve the efficiency of legal proceedings without violating fundamental procedural guarantees.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2402092436", "name": "Aram Edvardovich Arzumanyan", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

AI-driven applications, such as intelligent recommendation systems, virtual assistants, data-driven personalization, and predictive analytics, have better facilitated consumers' access to information, reduced uncertainty, and infused purchase-related evaluations. The case is particularly relevant in India, where EV adoption remains at its incipient stage despite increased environmental concerns and supportive policy initiatives. This paper examines the role of Artificial Intelligence in shaping consumer perception and behavioural response and, thereby, also investigates its influence on purchase intentions for electric vehicles amongst Indian consumers. A structured questionnaire survey was administered to 405 respondents residing in Coimbatore city, India, all of whom possessed valid driving licences. The sample included both current EV users and prospective adopters intending to purchase an EV soon. Descriptive statistics and inferential analytical techniques, including Independent Sample t-tests and Multiple Regression Analysis, were employed to assess the impact of AI-driven factors on consumer perception, perceived behavioural influence, and purchase intention. Findings uncovered a significant positive association between consumer perception, perceived behavioural influence, purchase intention, and electric vehicles using artificial intelligence.

This review of the literature explores 542 current articles to analyze the new paradigm of Green Artificial Intelligence as a group to make AI innovation and environmental stewardship align through energy-saving algorithms, green computing methods, and climate-aware implementation models. Our methodological approach was based on the PRISMA system, as we searched databases and filtered 1,052 records and finally settled on 534 articles, which directly relate to the topic of AI and sustainability. In our analysis, it is possible to note a tremendous advancement of energy-saving machine learning algorithms, green data centers, the integration of renewable energy usage, and artificial intelligence usage to monitor the environment and take climate action. Nevertheless, there exist decisive loopholes in the standardized measurement systems, lifecycle assessment approaches, harmonization of policies and fair access of green AI innovations in developing economies. The contribution of this review is the observation of seven major areas of implementation, the assessment of the emergent methods of energy optimization, issues of implementation and a hierarchical research agenda. ", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2352809257", "name": "Dimple Ravindra Patil", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2094038990", "name": "N.

Breast cancer treatments vary, with surgery being one of them. \nIn this review, we aim to evaluate artificial Intelligence’s ability to predict surgical outcomes, complications, and survival rates after breast cancer surgery by analyzing original research conducted over the last 5 years. \nMaterials and Methods: A PubMed search was conducted by two authors from January 1, 2020, to April 13, 2025, using the keywords \"Artificial Intelligence\" and \"Breast Surgery\". After elimination, 14 of the 215 articles were full-text screened, and nine original articles were selected for inclusion in our review. \nDiscussion: Artificial intelligence models and systems have had a significant impact on the medical field, and breast cancer surgery is no exception. Several original research studies have explored AI's ability to predict surgical outcomes and postoperative results. In this review, we focus on the postoperative aspects of breast cancer surgery and its application of artificial intelligence.  \nOf the nine articles included in this paper, all reported multiple statistically significant results (p <0.05). Although no prospective research directly compares artificial intelligence with practicing physicians, artificial intelligence’s ability to accurately predict surgical outcomes, complications, and survival has shown higher accuracy and c-index than commonly used prediction methods, as reported in multiple studies. \nConclusion: Artificial Intelligence can be a valuable asset in helping surgeons and medical doctors worldwide predict prognosis with improved systems and accuracy rates, even surpassing those of currently used conservative systems. There is a lack of information on PubMed regarding the comparison of these two aspects, particularly with larger sample sizes. More research should be conducted on this topic, particularly in comparing Artificial Intelligence systems and models with current systems and evaluation methods.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2247753801", "name": "Abdullah Emre Akşun", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2405952542", "name": "İsmail Canbaş", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2405945123", "name": "Arda Işık", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

Semi-structured interviews were conducted among 16 nursing postgraduates. Purposeful sampling was used to select master’s degree nursing students with experience in the use of artificial intelligence. Thematic analysis was performed to identify recurring patterns and codes. Five major themes emerged from the analysis: (1) performance expectancy, (2) effort expectancy, (3) social influence, (4) usage attitudes and behaviors, and (5) boundaries to Generative Artificial Intelligence adoption. The findings revealed nursing postgraduates’ generally positive perceptions and usage behaviors toward Generative Artificial Intelligence, alongside the barriers and concerns they associate with its application. Generative Artificial Intelligence is increasingly integrated into research and practice in healthcare and nursing. Nursing students should approach Generative Artificial Intelligence tools rationally and apply them appropriately.

This advancement presents novel opportunities for enhancing conceptual comprehension, especially in a field where students' intuitive notions tend to be consistent, coherent, and resistant to alteration. Simultaneously, AI systems often generate assertive yet erroneous reasoning, prompting apprehensions over epistemic trust, excessive dependence, and the perpetuation of fallacies. This Study analyzes artificial intelligence as an epistemic intermediary in physics education, emphasizing its role in conceptual transformation, inquiry-based pedagogy, and educator autonomy. Utilizing developing empirical evidence and theoretical frameworks, the paper contends that AI can enhance conceptual development by stimulating comparison, critique, and evidence-based reasoning, yet can hinder learning when regarded as an authoritative source of answers. The investigation underscores the transformation of teacher professional judgment in AI-enhanced classrooms and explores ethical and pedagogical limits concerning autonomy, equity, assessment integrity, and privacy. The article finishes by delineating essential research trajectories and underscoring that the educational efficacy of artificial intelligence is essentially contingent upon pedagogical design and ethical governance.

This paper introduces the AI Deployment Authorisation Score (ADAS), a machine-readable regulatory framework that evaluates AI systems across five legally and economically grounded dimensions: risk, alignment, externality, control, and auditability. ADAS produces a cryptographically verifiable deployment certificate that regulators, insurers, and infrastructure operators can consume as a license to operate, using public-key verification and transparency mechanisms adapted from secure software supply chain and certificate transparency systems. The paper presents the formal specification, decision logic, evidence model, and policy architecture of ADAS and demonstrates how it operationalizes the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act, United States critical infrastructure governance, and insurance underwriting requirements by compiling statutory and regulatory obligations into machine-executable deployment gates.

This paper presents a comprehensive review of the application of artificial intelligence techniques, including machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning, in improving droop control for renewable energy integration. These artificial intelligence-based methods address key challenges such as frequency and voltage regulation, power sharing, and grid compliance under conditions of high renewable penetration. Machine learning approaches, such as support vector machines, are used to optimize droop parameters for dynamic grid conditions, while deep learning models, including recurrent neural networks, capture complex system dynamics to enhance the stability of distributed energy systems. Reinforcement learning algorithms enable adaptive, autonomous control, improving multi-objective optimization within microgrids. In addition, emerging directions such as transfer learning and real-time data analytics are explored for their potential to enhance scalability and resilience. Overall, this review synthesizes recent advances to demonstrate the growing impact of artificial intelligence in droop control and outlines future pathways toward more intelligent and sustainable power systems.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2406708221", "name": "Michael Addai", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2247109149", "name": "P.

Specific Background: In practice, the use of AI in instructional design remains closely linked to teachers’ creativity in managing learning activities. Knowledge Gap: Existing studies often examine AI-based modules or teacher creativity separately, leaving limited understanding of their combined role in shaping student engagement in elementary schools. Aims: This study aims to examine the role of AI utilization in developing deep learning teaching modules together with teacher creativity in managing learning toward student engagement in South Bekasi elementary schools. Results: Using a quantitative causal associative design with multiple linear regression analysis, the findings indicate that teacher creativity shows a significant relationship with student engagement, while AI utilization alone does not demonstrate a statistically significant relationship. Simultaneously, both variables account for a substantial proportion of the variation in student engagement. Novelty: This study highlights the combined role of AI-based deep learning modules and teacher creativity as an integrated pedagogical construct rather than isolated factors. Implications: The findings suggest that AI-supported instructional planning requires creative pedagogical management by teachers to foster meaningful student engagement in elementary learning contexts.\nHighlights\n• Teacher creativity shows a significant statistical relationship with student engagement• AI-based deep learning modules alone do not demonstrate a significant relationship• Combined variables explain a large proportion of engagement variation in classrooms\nKeywords\nArtificial Intelligence; Deep Learning Modules; Teacher Creativity; Student Engagement; Elementary Education", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2406618529", "name": "Septian Dwi Anto", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2134518086", "name": "Misriandi Misriandi", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2406620373", "name": "Sri Imawati", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

In this context, this article analyzes the transition from intuitive management to a data-driven culture, examining the impacts of analytical marketing, automation, and artificial intelligence on organizational decision-making. Methodologically, a qualitative approach is adopted, of a theoretical and analytical-interpretative nature, based on a critical bibliographic review and thematic analysis, articulated in three interdependent axes: the managerial decision under limited rationality; the emergence of a data-driven culture in marketing and management; and the role of automation and artificial intelligence as decision support in business. The analysis shows that data, metrics and algorithms act as sociotechnical mediators of the decision-making process, expanding the informational capacity without eliminating the centrality of interpretation, critical judgment and managerial responsibility.

This study aims to leverage the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technologies to establish a dynamic, precise system for sports injury prediction and prevention, thereby reducing injury rates and enhancing rehabilitation strategies. A comprehensive sports injury feature database was developed by integrating multi-source data, including physiological parameters collected from wearable devices, biomechanical data from video motion capture systems, and clinical rehabilitation records. Machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, were employed to identify and analyze key risk factors for injuries, such as peak joint load and muscle fatigue index. Model performance was further optimized through A/B testing and cross-validation. Longitudinal cohort tracking of athletes was conducted, and the effectiveness of intervention measures was validated through a real-time feedback system. The AI-driven model demonstrated a predictive accuracy of 89.7% (AUC = 0.93), representing a substantial improvement over traditional methods, which achieved only 72.4% accuracy. For chronic injuries such as ankle instability, personalized intervention protocols led to a 34% reduction in recurrence rates. The exoskeleton-assisted rehabilitation system enhanced gait correction efficiency by 41% while simultaneously reducing recovery time. Furthermore, multimodal data fusion techniques successfully identified 15 high-risk movement patterns, providing objective, data-driven insights to optimize training regimens. The integration of AI and big data technologies facilitates the early detection and precise prevention of sports injuries through dynamic monitoring and sophisticated pattern recognition. Despite these advances, challenges related to data privacy, interdisciplinary collaboration, and algorithm transparency remain. Future research should focus on expanding the diversity of sample populations and exploring the potential application of AI in sports psychology interventions.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to offer numerous advantages over traditional neuropsychological practices, the most important of which is to improve clinical decision-making and thereby reduce diagnostic errors. However, the emergence, rapid availability, and adoption of AI, like other technological advances, has ethical implications. The purpose of this article is to present the ethical issues of primary importance in the adoption and application of AI in clinical neuropsychology and further advance the discussion of AI, ethics, and neuropsychology. Method: Benefits and risks of AI use in clinical neuropsychology are examined in the context of general bioethical principles. Results: Some of the primary anticipated risks that may lead to harmful outcomes for patients include: (1) threats to privacy and security, (2) bias in AI models, (3) lack of professional competence, (4) limitations to informed consent, (5) inequity in access to AI, (6) overreliance on AI, and (7) lack of accountability. Conclusions: Awareness and understanding of the ethical implications of technological advances, including AI, are essential for maintaining patient welfare at the center of clinical care and for preparing clinicians to anticipate ethical challenges and avoid dilemmas or address them effectively when they are encountered. Advanced preparation enables neuropsychologists to promote the ethical and responsible use of AI, for the benefit of both practitioners and patients.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2264167828", "name": "Shane S.

The disconnect between atomic scale design and lifecycle assessment (LCA) reflects fundamental challenges, data scarcity across heterogeneous sources, scale gaps from atoms to industrial systems, uncertainty in synthesis pathways, and the absence of frameworks that co-optimize performance with environmental impact. We propose to integrate upstream machine learning (ML) assisted materials discovery with downstream lifecycle assessment into a uniform ML-LCA environment. The framework ML-LCA integrates five components, information extraction for building materials-environment knowledge bases, harmonized databases linking properties to sustainability metrics, multi-scale models bridging atomic properties to lifecycle impacts, ensemble prediction of manufacturing pathways with uncertainty quantification, and uncertainty-aware optimization enabling simultaneous performance-sustainability navigation. Case studies spanning glass, cement, semiconductor photoresists, and polymers demonstrate both necessity and feasibility while identifying material-specific integration challenges.

With the help of AI, a sudden spurt of artists, authors and other literary people has sprung forth on the literary horizon. Now, anyone can become a writer, poet, artist or so, within no time. There is no need for talent and calibre. As a consequence, a large number of such fake talents in the field of art and literature are producing their AI-inspired works without making any substantial effort. Not only this, these pseudo-artists and writers are also making money. In the field of cinema, AI-generated scripts and music have become the order of the day. Another frightening aspect is the growth of vandalism. Some unscrupulous people have even tried to create caricatures and funny variants of many famous paintings by renowned painters. The disfiguration of the world-famous painting of Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci is a classic example.

Classical adjuvants, including alum, oil-in-water emulsions, liposomal formulations, and toll-like receptor agonists, function by fueling innate immunity, promoting antigen presentation, and modulating cytokine milieus. Yet, these compounds face persistent limitations such as reactogenicity, species-specific responses, manufacturing complexity, and regulatory barriers. Artificial intelligence (AI) and core subfields such as machine learning are revolutionizing vaccine design by enhancing antigen engineering, delivery system optimization, immunogenicity modeling, and\n in silico\n screening of novel immune potentiators. Here, I propose a speculative yet testable hypothesis: AI-driven design of potent antigens may progressively replace classical adjuvants. By embedding adjuvant-like functions directly into computationally designed antigens, AI-designed vaccines could replicate or excel the mechanistic roles of traditional adjuvants. This perspective critically explores current AI applications in vaccinology, discusses key challenges in the field, including biological complexity, data limitations, safety, and regulatory and ethical considerations, and outline the spectrum of adjuvant replacement—from augmentation to full substitution. Finally, a roadmap is proposed for transitioning toward AI-driven adjuvant surrogates. Notably, this work highlights a potential paradigm shift in vaccine design, suggesting that future advances will lead to a gradual, stepwise transition from the use of traditional adjuvants to computationally guided antigens and delivery platforms capable of outperforming classical adjuvant functions, thus creating a new vaccine era without exogenous chemical additives.\n", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2319856506", "name": "Jose G.

The state, as the most powerful tool for organizing social processes, cannot but pay attention to innovations that permeate almost all spheres of society. Artificial intelligence provides the state with new tools, but it also requires government influence in order to ensure the security of society and regulate changing social relations. The purpose of the article is to conduct a theoretical analysis and determine the optimal model of government intervention in the formation of legal norms that regulate public relations arising in connection with the creation and application of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The conducted theoretical analysis allows us to conclude that the role of the state in regulating legal relations related to AI should be fundamentally new — not absolutely limiting but guiding and ensuring the development of these technologies. The State needs to create an adaptive legal environment based on relevant ethical and legal principles, which should be based on stimulating innovation and mandatory consideration of risks to society. State standards in the field of AI are of fundamental importance today, outlining the contours for future legal regulation through laws and regulations. There is an obvious need to introduce flexible regulatory models, such as experimental legal regimes, which will allow law to evolve synchronously with technological progress, ensuring legal certainty and protection of public and private interests.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2248167812", "name": "A.

One of the most notable applications is the role of artificial intelligence in diagnostics. AI processes, particularly those powered by deep learning, are now capable of analyzing medical images, detecting patterns, and identifying early stages of diseases with greater accuracy than many human clinicians [1].\nForensic medicine, an area heavily reliant on the intersection of law and medicine, can also benefit from artificial intelligence. AI-powered tools are increasingly used in the identification of causes of death, analyzing autopsy reports, and even recognizing delicate forensic evidence in cases of suspected abuse, or poisoning, DNA evidence, pattern recognition, face recognition, crime scene reconstruction, digital forensics, image-processing, forensic ballistic, and gunshot identification tracking bullet pathway. By analyzing large amounts of data, AI can assist forensic pathologists in making more informed, faster decisions [2].\nMedico-legal cases often involve complex connections of healthcare, law, and ethics. Whether in misconduct claims, negligence, determining liability in cases of medical negligence, postmortem interval estimation, or the estimation of different causes of death. AI has the potential to significantly streamline legal proceedings, improve the accuracy of judgments, and support forensic experts' decision-making. In legal research, AI can analyze vast amounts of legal documents, past case histories, and medical records to provide lawyers with relevant information faster than human assistants [3].\nDespite its potential, integrating AI into the medico-legal and healthcare systems raises several ethical and legal concerns. One major issue is data privacy. The immense amounts of personal & medical data that AI systems require are highly sensitive, and illegal access or breaches can have tragic consequences for patients [4]. Superfluous challenge is accountability. When an AI system makes an error, whether it be a misdiagnosis, a mistake in medical cases, or an incorrect legal valuation, who is to be held responsible? The developers of the AI? The healthcare provider or legal professional who used the AI tool? These questions are not yet fully spoken, and new legal frameworks may be needed to determine liability and accountability in these situations [3, 4]. The application of AI and machine learning techniques in forensic toxicology includes predictive toxicology, expansion of AI-driven spectral libraries, computerization of analytical workflows, and integration of multi-omics data for comprehensive toxicological profiling [5]. It has already begun to restructure healthcare and the medico-legal system; its full potential has yet to be realized. \nMoving forward, integrating AI into these arenas will require a collaborative effort among medical technologists, healthcare providers, legal authorities, and policymakers. Finally, as we move towards a more technology-driven era, the balance between human findings and machine efficiency will be vital to achieving the best outcomes for all. It is an immense challenge for medico-legal and forensic experts to make use of artificial intelligence; it should be perceived as a complementary instrument that enhances rather than replaces human judgment. A carefully regulated and ethically guided adoption of AI can pave the way toward a more efficient, equitable, and transparent medico-legal and healthcare system.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2408210169", "name": "Farzana Azam Khan", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2408447142", "name": "Syed Mukkaram Ali", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

However, its integration into clinical practice raises complex ethical challenges that must be addressed to ensure responsible and equitable use. This chapter aims to explore the ethical implications of AI in surgery through the lens of the four foundational principles of medical ethics: autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. Respecting patient autonomy requires clinicians to disclose all relevant information and ensure understanding of a proposed intervention (or AI tool) for a patient to make an informed, voluntary decision. Numerous studies have shown that both patients and clinicians often lack sufficient understanding of AI tools, complicating efforts to explain their intended function, or obtain truly informed consent for their use in patient care. This has the potential to diminish trust in the patient–clinician relationship and must be considered when using AI tools. AI's potential to uphold beneficence is evident in its ability to enhance surgical precision and outcomes. Yet, its reliance on historical data introduces risks of bias and error, threatening the principle of nonmaleficence. In this chapter, we explore these topics further to highlight the need for robust oversight and clinician involvement to prevent harm to patients. When biased data are used to train an AI tool, it may lead to unequal care across patient populations—i.e., exacerbating existing disparities in health care. Additionally, the lack of clear accountability for AI-driven errors raises legal and ethical concerns about liability—whether it lies with clinicians, health care institutions, or developers. To ethically integrate AI into surgical practice, the chapter calls for comprehensive frameworks that ensure transparency, data integrity, clinician and patient education, and regulatory oversight. These measures are essential to safeguard patient welfare as AI continues to reshape the future of surgical care.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2284746396", "name": "Nicole Meredyth", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2384422148", "name": "Paola A.

Taking typical cases such as the Tencent Dreamwriter case as the starting point, this paper systematically explores the difficulties in identifying the tortuous liability of generative artificial intelligence under the existing legal framework, focusing on disputes over the liability of service providers, the predicament of determining negligence caused by algorithmic flaws, and the ambiguity in defining infringing acts. Through a comparative analysis of domestic and international legislative practices, the study reveals the \"instrumental\" essence of generative AI and the core of disputes regarding its legal nature: as the controllers of the technology, service providers are obligated to fulfill legal responsibilities such as data compliance review, labeling of generated content, and filtering of illegal information. Furthermore, the study proposes a functionalist approach to determining tortuous liability, combining the \"equivalent causation theory\" with the principle of judicial classification to construct a dynamic framework for liability division. At the level of risk regulation, China has established a governance system integrating policy guidance and technical supervision, and has strengthened algorithmic transparency and content traceability through the Measures for the Labeling of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Synthesized Content.

Traditional methods like motion capture, force plates, and wearable sensors, while great, are very expensive and require a specific environment in which to work. Because of this, they are not very accessible. These methods may take a long time to analyze. However, with the advent of newer methods of Artificial intelligence, we can automate feature detection, analyze in real time, and extract even more findings in more variables. \nMethods: For this study, a combination of different methodologies was used. For the qualitative analysis of the models, the author used data from the sensors, videos, and the clinical documentation of patients with neuromuscular and musculoskeletal disorders. The author used machine learning classifiers, convolutional neural networks, and long short-term memory networks to analyze and classify gait and predict rehabilitation potential in order to handle performance evaluation in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and robustness. \nResults: AI-based systems consistently outperformed traditional methods. Clinical applications demonstrated earlier detection of neurological disorders, wearable AI devices improved rehabilitation adherence, and computer vision models showed resilience under variable conditions such as lighting and clothing. In sports, AI provided real time biomechanical feedback to reduce injury risk and enhance performance. In security, AI-driven gait recognition strengthened biometric identification by adapting to environmental variability. \nConclusion: AI is not merely an incremental improvement but a paradigm shift in gait and movement analysis. By bridging laboratory precision with real-world scalability, AI offers inclusive, accessible, and transformative solutions.

AI-driven accounting solutions reduce human error and operating expenses by automating repetitive operations like data entry, reconciliation, and financial reporting. By examining vast amounts of organized and unstructured data to spot irregularities and guarantee conformity with legal standards, artificial intelligence (AI) helps with tax planning, compliance, and fraud detection. The use of AI-based solutions that facilitate risk assessment, continuous auditing, and real-time transaction detection is also changing auditing methods. By extending coverage beyond conventional sampling techniques, these technologies enhance audit quality. Notwithstanding its benefits, integrating AI presents issues with data protection, ethics, regulatory approval, and the requirement for qualified personnel. This paper explores how artificial intelligence (AI) is changing accounting, taxation, and auditing procedures, emphasizing its advantages, uses, and related difficulties in the contemporary financial landscape.\n\nKeywords:-  Artificial Intelligence, Auditing, Accounting, Taxation", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2404687423", "name": "Dr. Priyanka Jain", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

It analyses the principal institutional challenges faced by public authorities in the implementation of algorithmic solutions, including the need to modernise organisational structures, develop the professional competencies of civil servants, and ensure transparency, accountability, and ethical justification of automated administrative procedures. \nParticular attention is paid to the evolution of managerial practices, manifested in a gradual shift from traditional administrative procedures towards data-centric, predictive, and algorithmically supported models of decision-making. It is argued that the integration of artificial intelligence leads to the emergence of new forms of administrative discretion, alters the balance between human and automated influence within governance processes, and exerts a significant impact on the structure of public policy, performance evaluation mechanisms, and the quality of public service delivery. \nFrom a regulatory and legal perspective, the article examines contemporary European approaches to the governance of artificial intelligence, including requirements related to safety, transparency, non-discrimination, and the protection of human rights. The significance of European Union legal acts, ethical principles developed by the Council of Europe, and recommendations of international organisations is outlined, as these instruments establish framework standards for the responsible use of algorithmic systems in the public sector. The article substantiates the necessity of developing a national regulatory model capable of reconciling technological innovation, administrative efficiency, and guarantees of democratic legitimacy. \nIt is concluded that the effectiveness of digital transformation in public administration depends not solely on the technological capacity of artificial intelligence, but primarily on the institutional capability of the state, the quality of legal regulation, and the ability to ensure an appropriate level of public trust in algorithmically supported administrative decisions, including through the implementation of risk assessment procedures, oversight mechanisms, and accountability frameworks governing the use of artificial intelligence.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "1742270908", "name": "I.

Rapid advancements in AI technologies altered traditional entrepreneurial practices by enabling data-driven decision-making, predictive analytics, and automation of routine tasks. Using a quantitative research design, data were collected from 350 entrepreneurs and managers of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) who had adopted AI in their business operations. Descriptive statistics, reliability tests, regression analysis, and structural equation modelling (SEM) were employed to analyse the relationships between AI adoption and entrepreneurial outcomes. The results revealed that AI adoption significantly enhanced opportunity recognition by enabling entrepreneurs to identify emerging market trends, assess risks, and make informed strategic decisions. AI also facilitated labour substitution by automating repetitive tasks, allowing human resources to focus on creative and analytical roles. Moreover, AI-driven innovation processes accelerated product development, improved operational efficiency, and supported experimentation, thereby strengthening entrepreneurial performance. Despite these positive outcomes, challenges such as workforce displacement, ethical concerns, and limited access to AI technologies were identified as barriers to full adoption. The study concluded that AI functions as a strategic enabler that reshapes entrepreneurial practices, labour dynamics, and innovation strategies. The findings provide valuable insights for entrepreneurs, policymakers, and academic institutions to implement adaptive strategies for sustainable and inclusive entrepreneurial growth in the era of artificial intelligence. \nReferences \nAli, A., & Rafiq-uz-Zaman, M.

Given its rising global prevalence and economic burden, artificial intelligence offers promising solutions across the care continuum, from diagnosis to monitoring. This review highlights recent advances in artificial intelligence-driven diagnosis and monitoring, risk stratification, and predictive modelling of hypertension-related outcomes. Recent findings Using artificial intelligence-based technologies, validated wearable cuffless monitors are developed, which use electrocardiography, heart sounds, and thoracic impedance data and provide continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring. Artificial intelligence-generated algorithm have shown promising response to accurately predict BP. The Extreme Gradient Boost has consistently performed as the best algorithms. Additionally, these models have been used in predicting hypertension impact on cardiovascular, renal, and retinal conditions, and in predicting treatment strategies. Emerging applications of Large Language Models are being developed to provide personalized care based on individual patient characteristics. Summary Artificial intelligence has the potential to transform hypertension management through improved diagnosis, monitoring, and personalized care and prediction of its systemic consequences. However, challenges of model validation, interpretability, generalizability, and ethics persist. Robust prospective trials and equitable implementation strategies can help realise the potential of artificial intelligence in improving hypertension outcomes.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2402883370", "name": "Mukesh Dherani", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2388988703", "name": "Siegfried K.

While AI applications demonstrate high efficacy within isolated domains, they rarely achieve the cross-domain integration necessary for realizing systemic benefits. Our prior research identified this fragmentation paradox, revealing that 91.5% of urban AI implementations operate at the lowest levels of integration. While the Urban Systems Artificial Intelligence Framework (UAIF) offers a technical blueprint for integration, realizing this vision is contingent upon organizational readiness. This paper addresses this critical gap by introducing the Urban AI Governance Maturity Model (UAIG), developed using a Design Science Research methodology. Distinguished from generic maturity models, the UAIG operationalizes Socio-Technical Systems theory by establishing a direct Governance-Technology Interlock that specifically links organizational maturity levels to the engineering requirements of cross-domain AI. The model defines five maturity levels across five critical dimensions: Strategy and Investment; Organizational Structure and Culture; Data Governance and Policy; Technical Capacity and Interoperability; and Trust, Ethics, and Security. Through illustrative applications, we demonstrate how the UAIG serves as a diagnostic tool and a strategic roadmap, enabling policymakers to bridge the gap between technical possibility and organizational reality.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2386249926", "name": "Omar Alrasbi", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "1938610", "name": "S.

Also known as AI, artificial intelligence is used every day in an increasing number of tasks. However, AI is also a controversial topic. Despite its many benefits, specialists also warn of its risks. Amid this debate, numerous projects continue to explore new and more complex uses for this technology. One of these areas is the administration of justice. From its use as a legal information search tool to its potential deployment as an artificial judge or mediator, AI undoubtedly has the potential to bring about profound changes in the justice system in the future. In this context, the present study seeks to analyze the suitability of the current Mexican legal framework both to leverage the opportunities offered by artificial intelligence and to address its challenges in the administration of justice. To this end, the case of the new civil and family justice model, which will begin upon the entry into force of the National Code of Civil and Family Procedure projected for April 2027, will be used.

However, these innovations raise concerns about professional adaptation and job security.\nObjectives: To investigate Nigerian radiographers’ awareness, perceptions, and adaptability regarding these technologies, with a focus on job security and professional relevance.\nMethod: A cross-sectional survey of 349 Nigerian radiographers assessed awareness, perceptions, and adaptability regarding AI and theranostics. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics (SPSS v25).\nResults: Awareness was higher for AI than theranostics: 31.2% were moderately familiar and 28.7% very familiar with AI, whereas 34.4% were not familiar with theranostics. Most respondents (64.5%) had not attended training or seminars. Regarding job security, 41.8% agreed AI and theranostics could reduce the demand for manual radiography skills, and 30.7% agreed automation might cause role displacement. Nevertheless, adaptability was promising: 51.3% expressed interest in further education or certification, and 48.1% viewed adoption as an opportunity for career growth. Key adaptation factors included mentorship (50.7%), financial support (45.6%), and curriculum integration (41.5%).\nConclusion: Nigerian radiographers demonstrate moderate familiarity with AI but limited understanding of theranostics. While job security concerns persist, willingness to upskill is strong. Structured training, mentorship, and curriculum reform are essential to support professional adaptation and safeguard radiographers’ relevance in the era of AI and theranostics.\nContribution: This study highlights the need for radiography professional bodies and policymakers to prioritize structured training pathways, financial incentives, and cross-disciplinary collaborations to ensure radiographers remain central to technological transitions.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nIntroduction\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and theranostics are rapidly transforming healthcare, particularly within medical imaging and radiographic practice, some of which include workflow optimization, image acquisition, diagnostic interpretation, and treatment planning (1).\nRecent advances in deep learning and neural networks have accelerated the integration of AI into clinical imaging, offering greater efficiency, improved accuracy, and enhanced patient safety (2). In parallel, theranostics — an approach that combines diagnostic imaging with targeted therapy — has gained increasing importance in nuclear medicine and precision oncology (3). By enabling clinicians to both detect and treat specific pathologies, theranostics exemplifies the move toward personalized medicine.\nGlobally, radiographers’ perceptions of these innovations have been mixed. While many acknowledge AI’s capacity to reduce errors, optimize workflows, and advance radio-graphic practice, others express concerns about automation leading to job displacement (4, 5). A study in Zimbabwe found that radiographers anticipated reduced roles and altered professional practices with AI adoption (6).\nSimilarly, Saudi Arabian radiographers largely agreed that AI would play a significant role in imaging, but cited barriers such as cost, lack of expertise, and machine reliability (7). Badera et al. (8) reported generally favorable attitudes toward AI among radiographers and radiologists but highlighted mentorship gaps as a key obstacle to adoption. These findings illustrate the global tension between optimism about technological progress and apprehension about professional security.\nDespite these developments, the Nigerian context remains underexplored. Although AI and theranostics are increasingly discussed in international literature, limited research has examined how Nigerian radiographers perceive these technologies or how prepared they are to adapt. Considering Nigeria’s evolving healthcare infrastructure, absence of theranostics training in most radiography curricula, and limited access to mentorship and continuing education, this knowledge gap is particularly significant. Without understanding local awareness and readiness, the professional practice in Nigeria risks falling behind in adapting to global technological shifts.\nThis study therefore investigates Nigerian radiographers’ awareness, perceptions, and adaptability regarding AI and theranostics. Specifically, it examines their concerns about job security, willingness to upskill, and the structural and educational supports necessary for effective professional adaptation.\nMaterials and Methods\nThis study employed a prospective cross-sectional survey design, conducted between October 2024 and January 2025 across private and federal government hospitals in Nigeria. Ethical clearance was obtained from an institutions review board (NHREC/05/01/2008B-FWA00002458-1RB00002323). The study population consisted of licensed radiographers registered with the Radiographers Registration Board of Nigeria (RRBN). Only practicing radiographers who consented to participate were included, while other healthcare workers, academic radiographers, industrial radiographers, and radiographers unwilling to participate were excluded.\nA convenience sampling technique was used and data were collected using a structured, self-administered questionnaire designed in Google Forms. The instrument consisted of three sections: Section I covered demographic characteristics such as age, gender, years of practice, specialty, and geopolitical zone of practice; Section II assessed awareness and understanding of AI and theranostics; while Section III focused on perceptions of job security, willingness to adapt, and factors influencing adaptation.\nThe questionnaire was pretested on 15 radiographers at a university teaching hospital to assess internal consistency using Cronbach’s alpha, and this yielded a coefficient of 0.79, indicating acceptable reliability. Content validity was ensured through expert review by radiography lecturers and clinical practitioners. The questionnaire link was distributed via professional WhatsApp groups, LinkedIn, email lists, and direct contacts of practicing radiographers. Participation was voluntary, and informed consent was obtained prior to completing the survey.\nCompleted responses were exported from Google Forms into IBM SPSS version 25 for analysis. Descriptive statistics such as frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations were used to summarize demographic and awareness data, while inferential statistics, including cross-tabulations and mean comparisons, were applied to explore perceptions and adaptability patterns. Results were presented in tables for clarity. Anonymity was maintained by ensuring that no personal identifiers were collected, and data were stored securely for academic purposes only. \nResults\nDemographic Characteristics\nOf the 349 radiographers who participated in the study, majority were male (56.7%) and within the 25–34 years age group (46.1%). Most respondents had practiced for fewer than five years (61.6%), reflecting a predominantly early-career workforce. The South-East geopolitical zone contributed the highest proportion of respondents (39.5%), while diagnostic radiography was the most common specialty (79.7%) (Table 1).\nAwareness and Understanding of AI and Theranostics\nFrom Table 2, familiarity with AI was generally higher than with theranostics. About 31.2% reported being moderately familiar with AI and 28.7% very familiar, while only 7.4% were not familiar at all. In contrast, awareness of theranostics was low, with 34.4% reporting no familiarity and only 7.7% describing themselves as extremely familiar. Knowledge sufficiency was also limited, as 42.7% either disagreed or strongly disagreed that their current knowledge of AI and theranostics was adequate to meet future professional demands. Furthermore, 64.5% of respondents had never attended training or seminars on either technology.\nPerceptions of Job Security\nConcerns about job security were evident. More than two-fifths of respondents (41.8%) agreed that AI and theranostics could reduce the demand for manual radiography skills, while 30.7% agreed that automation might lead to role displacement. At the same time, 74.5% acknowledged that integration of these technologies would require radiographers to acquire new skills to remain relevant (Table 3).\nWillingness to Adapt\nDespite concerns, respondents expressed a strong willingness to adapt. Over half (51.3%) indicated interest in pursuing further education or certifications in AI and theranostics, while 48.1% agreed that adoption of these technologies represented an opportunity for personal growth. Although peer resistance was reported as a possible barrier, most respondents viewed adaptation positively (Table 4).\nFactors Influencing Adaptation\nIn Table 5, more than half (50.7%) agreed that access to structured mentorship programs would facilitate adaptation, and 45.6% emphasized the need for financial support or incentives from employers. A further 41.5% supported the inclusion of AI and theranostics training in undergraduate curricula, while 44.4% highlighted the importance of collaboration with other healthcare professionals. However, workplace infrastructure was identified as a barrier, as only 40.1% agreed that their facilities had sufficient technological support.\nDiscussion\nRadiographers in this study demonstrated higher familiarity with artificial intelligence (AI) than with theranostics, a pattern that reflects the relative availability of these technologies in Nigeria. While AI is beginning to attract interest in some private institutions, it has not yet been integrated into routine clinical practice or healthcare policy (9 – 12).\nBy contrast, theranostics remains entirely theoretical in developing countries, with no established faci", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2364452185", "name": "Sobechukwu Onwuzu", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2408070699", "name": "Adanna Uche-Nwankwo", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2408077898", "name": "Chinemerem Ozoamalu", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2408079245", "name": "Chikaosolu Ozohili", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2408075937", "name": "Ezinne Peter-Adim", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2408080149", "name": "Prisca Solomon", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2408074546", "name": "Precious Sopuluchukwu", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2408074012", "name": "Ikechuwku Onwunta", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

Building on a mixed-methods baseline study grounded originally in the Theory of Planned Behavior, the research applies Freirean concepts – the “banking” model of education, problem-posing pedagogy, dialogic learning, and conscientization – as a new lens. The reanalysis reveals that students clustered by the original study into two profiles exhibit markedly different relationships with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Cluster 1 students, those with mature epistemological beliefs, cautious ChatGPT attitudes, minimal dishonesty, demonstrate a more critical and self-directed engagement with AI, echoing Freire’s vision of learners as co-creators of knowledge. Cluster 2 students, those with naï ve epistemological beliefs, positive ChatGPT attitudes, higher dishonesty, often treat ChatGPT as an authoritative source of answers which is a pattern akin to Freire’s banking model, with risks of dependency and surface learning. Freire’s framework highlights contradictions in the AI-assisted classroom that while generative AI can support learning, it can also reinforce passive consumption of information and undermine student autonomy if uncritically used. The discussion culminates in educational implications, arguing for a dialogical and critical pedagogical integration of AI. By conscientizing both educators and learners about AI’s opportunities and pitfalls, the Freirean approach can help transform the use of tools like ChatGPT from a shortcut that threatens academic honesty into a catalyst for empowerment, critical thinking, and co-learning in the modern classroom.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2407359314", "name": "Bryan M Nozaleda", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2407359630", "name": "Beverly M Addun", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

The emerging new paradigm called agentic AI involves agents that move beyond decision support tools to becoming semi-autonomous collaborators in research, clinical, and rehabilitation tasks.\n\n\nPURPOSE\nThe purpose of this review is to summarize how recent advances (April 2022 to October 2025) in automation, prediction, and augmentation agents are poised to transform the practice of orthopaedics; and to outline the conceptual, technical, and ethical foundations of this transition.\n\n\nRECENT FINDINGS\nAn agent is software that can process information and act independently to execute a set of defined tasks. It can seek knowledge, ask for help, deploy other software, and learn from its actions. Automation, prediction and augmentation agents can be leveraged in multi-agent and federated-learning architectures, working together to create coordinated ecosystems that can manage complex tasks and that improve with clinical use. Collectively, the output of such ecosystems is referred to as agentic AI. However, regulatory and ethical concerns underscore the need for transparency, equity, and the preservation of human agency within these frameworks.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nAgentic AI marks a transition from passive tools that merely assist clinicians to autonomous systems that act alongside them.

Since the detection of depression is currently based largely on subjective self-reporting, there is an urgent need for fast, objective, and reliable detection methods. In our study, we present an artificial intelligence-based system that combines iris-based identification with the analysis of pupillometric and eye movement biomarkers, enabling the real-time detection of physiological signs of depression before driving or flying. The two-module model was evaluated based on data from 242 participants: the iris identification module operated with an Equal Error Rate of less than 0.5%, while the depression-detecting CNN-LSTM network achieved 89% accuracy and an AUC value of 0.94. Compared to the neutral state, depressed individuals responded to negative news with significantly greater pupil dilation (+27.9% vs. +18.4%), while showing a reduced or minimal response to positive stimuli (−1.3% vs. +6.2%). This was complemented by slower saccadic movement and longer fixation time, which is consistent with the cognitive distortions characteristic of depression. Our results indicate that pupillometric deviations relative to individual baselines can be reliably detected and used with high accuracy for depression screening. The presented system offers a preventive safety solution that could reduce the number of accidents caused by human error related to depression in road and air traffic in the future.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2275822217", "name": "Gábor Kiss", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2382180507", "name": "Patrik Viktor", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": ["Medicine"]}

The results show that technologies such as machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing can effectively improve the efficiency and service level of garden management. Specifically, the intelligent planning system can optimize the spatial layout of the garden; the plant identification and health monitoring system can achieve precise maintenance; and the intelligent guide and recommendation system can provide personalized services. However, the application of technology still faces challenges such as data acquisition, algorithm optimization, and ethical privacy. Future research should focus on multi-source heterogeneous data fusion, deep learning model optimization, and human-computer collaboration mechanisms to promote the deep integration of artificial intelligence and landscape architecture management and build a smart, efficient, and sustainable modern garden management system.

The mechanism test results indicate that artificial intelligence inhibits enterprise resilience through three pathways: increasing the level of financing constraints, enhancing the intensity of R&D investment, and raising the management expense ratio. The heterogeneity test results further reveal the differences in its inhibitory effects, showing that artificial intelligence has a more pronounced inhibitory impact on enterprise resilience in the eastern region, in non-manufacturing industries, and among heavily polluting enterprises.

Artificial intelligence can automate routine tasks (such as data entry and preparing returns), which can reduce errors and increase efficiency. Tax teams currently spend a significant amount of their time collecting and manipulating data, which artificial intelligence can do in a fraction of the time. Automation allows professionals to focus on higher value-added analytical and advisory tasks. Tax authorities actively use artificial intelligence for predictive analytics and network research to detect suspected tax evasion and fraud. Artificial intelligence helps analyse large amounts of financial data and identify suspicious patterns, making audits faster and more accurate. The introduction of a global minimum tax is an extremely complex and data-intensive process, for which multinational companies use artificial intelligence-based software to automate calculations and predict tax burdens. Companies that do not integrate artificial intelligence may find themselves at a significant competitive disadvantage. It is important to examine the legal and ethical framework for the use of artificial intelligence in taxation, ensuring transparency, data protection and algorithmic impartiality to avoid discriminatory bias.

The present work uses the filmic narrative of Annihilation (2018) to challenge the persistent dismissal of AI’s creative capabilities. Such skepticism often hinges on the problematic assumption that human traits—such as inspiration, intuition, consciousness, spontaneity, will, or emotion—are pre-requisites for creativity. This line of argumentation relies on an anthropomorphic approach that is unable to imagine or accept non-human modes of perception, cognition, and agency. Instead, the study first proposes adopting an apophatic approach, through which AI is defined not by the projection of human qualities but rather via negation, emphasizing what lies beyond human understanding. It then advocates for “alien phenomenology” as a method for accepting the non-human cognitive capabilities of AI. Accepting AI as an “alien intelligence” shifts the role of the artist toward critique and curation, underscoring the artistic talent in recognizing unexplored, alien forms of beauty.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2406686358", "name": "Vahid Vahdat", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

In this work, we present a comprehensive review and synthesis of AI TRiSM, uniting five foundational pillars: explainability with real‐time drift monitoring, ModelOps governance, application‐level security, data protection and privacy, and adversarial resilience. We introduce three aligned taxonomies for trust dimensions (e.g., fairness, transparency, accountability, inclusiveness, ethical alignment), risk categories (e.g., model, data, legal, operational, societal, cognitive, emergent, third‐party) and security controls (e.g., access management, infrastructure hardening, runtime enforcement, privacy‐enhancing techniques). Building on these, we develop a detailed toxicity taxonomy for generative AI—covering hate, violence, self‐harm, misinformation, bias, jailbreak attacks, multimodal harms, and more—each mapped to specific TRiSM safeguards. Through cross‐domain case studies in finance, healthcare, autonomous vehicles, public sector, cybersecurity, and beyond, we illustrate practical integration patterns and governance workflows. We also identify key adoption challenges—fragmented tooling, late‐stage governance, scalability constraints, evolving threats and regulations—and chart a forward‐looking roadmap toward adaptive, AI‐driven policy engines, causal explainability, privacy‐by‐design pipelines, continuous real‐time assurance, federated governance, quantum‐safe architectures, and sustainable “green AI” practices.

AI intelligence is likely to be strange intelligence, defying familiar patterns of ability and inability, combining superhuman capacities in some domains with subhuman performance in other domains, and even within domains sometimes combining superhuman insight with surprising errors that few humans would make. We develop and defend a nonlinear model of intelligence on which\"general intelligence\"is not a unified capacity but instead the ability to achieve a broad range of goals in a broad range of environments, in a manner that defies nonarbitrary reduction to a single linear quantity. We conclude with implications for adversarial testing approaches to evaluating AI capacities. If AI is strange intelligence, we should expect that even the most capable systems will sometimes fail in seemingly obvious tasks. On a nonlinear model of AI intelligence, such errors on their own do not demonstrate a system's lack of outstanding general intelligence. Conversely, excellent performance on one type of task, such as an IQ test, cannot warrant assumptions of broad capacities beyond that task domain.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "147197121", "name": "Kendra Chilson", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2408796344", "name": "Eric Schwitzgebel", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science"]}

Quantum dots (QDs), with size‐tunable bandgaps and favorable interfacial properties, significantly enhance photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting by enabling broad‐spectrum light harvesting, optimized band alignment, and improved charge separation. However, QD design strategies for PEC systems remain less developed compared to those for light‐emitting diodes and solar cells, constrained by incomplete understanding of interfacial photophysics, limited exploration of low‐dimensional nanocrystals (1D/2D), and the absence of AI‐assisted optimization. This review provides a comprehensive overview of material design strategies for QDs in PEC hydrogen production, encompassing fundamental principles, established approaches, and recent advances in both heavy‐metal‐based and nontoxic systems. Particular attention is given to emerging paradigms such as dimensional control and AI‐driven optimization, which enable predictive modeling, accelerated synthesis, and performance tuning beyond conventional trial‐and‐error methods. Finally, we address critical challenges—including stability, toxicity, and scalability—and outline future directions for achieving efficient, sustainable QD‐based PEC systems suitable for practical and economically viable commercialization.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2218047206", "name": "Hyo Cheol Lee", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "4265371", "name": "Su-il In", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

This research employed a quantitative approach to develop an overall conceptual model that encompasses both the technical and behavioral aspects of intelligent system adoption. The target population consisted of customs officers, border security personnel, and IT personnel responsible for customs clearance and trade facilitation in Jordan. The structured questionnaires were administered to the respondents to measure their perceptions of system effectiveness, satisfaction, performance outcomes, and evasion behavior and yielded a total of 358 valid responses. The research was conducted with proper statistical analysis, and the statistical techniques employed included primary data collected via SPSS Version 29 and advanced modeling using Structural Equation Modeling-Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS) through the use of SmartPLS 4.0. The results indicated that the measurement model proved to be both valid and reliable, with Cronbach's alpha values exceeding 0.82 and AVE values above 0.50, indicating good internal consistency and convergent validity. Moreover, the structural model achieved good explanatory power, with R² values of 59% for Customs Evasion, 43% for User Satisfaction, and 100% for Digital Performance Indicators. These findings underscore the significance of user satisfaction as a key outcome of system effectiveness and a valuable tool for enhancing performance and deterrence. More specifically, the results shown how Intelligent System Effectiveness presents a positive and significant impact on User Satisfaction (β = 0.656, p < 0.001), which in turn has a high positive effect on both Digital Performance Indicators (β = 1.000, p < 0.001) and Customs Evasion reduction (β = 0.770, p < 0.001). The mediation analysis also confirmed that User Satisfaction fully mediates the relationship between system effectiveness and performance outcome, as well as between system effectiveness and evasion reduction. This research contributes to theory and practice by demystifying the design and implementation of AI-driven customs systems. It illustrates the importance of valuing both technical system quality and user-centric values in achieving and maintaining optimal performance in the digital space, as well as conformance with the law.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2345486156", "name": "A.

This empirical research is based on the practical experience of the world’s top 20 countries in AI development in 2020 and 2024, as reflected in the socio-economic statistics of these nations. As a result, the authors developed an econometric model of AI’s impact on the digital society in Russia and other leading AI countries. Drawing on this model, the primary conclusion is that the key specific conditions for the diffusion of AI, which, in turn, shape the development of a digital society in Russia, are the innovativeness of AI technologies, social adaptation to AI, and the accessibility and reliability of AI infrastructure. The scientific novelty and theoretical contribution of this research lie in clarifying the social consequences of modernizing economic systems based on AI. The comparative and trend analysis reveals that Russia’s AI exhibits high global competitiveness (with Russia ranking among the world leaders in overall terms and specific conditions for AI diffusion during 2020–2024), as well as favorable trends in AI (five-year trends indicating improvements in overall and specific conditions for AI diffusion), which encourage further development of the digital society in Russia. The research outlines the prospects for developing a digital society in Russia under the influence of AI through two alternative scenarios – one envisioning the evolution of the digital society in Russia and the other suggesting enhanced inclusiveness, thus highlighting the alternative nature of these digital society characteristics.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2404748660", "name": "Konstantin Vodenko", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2404752936", "name": "Platon A.

Large language models and autonomous agents increasingly discover, understand, and orchestrate APIs with minimal human intervention, reshaping integration paradigms across domains. This systematic review (2020–2026) analyzes emerging AI‑native API ecosystems along six dimensions: functionality, security, governance, architecture, efficiency, and application areas. The findings highlight an evolution from conventional REST, SOAP, and messaging architectures to adaptive, context‑aware, and policy‑driven interface models. Concurrently, novel security risks—such as prompt injection, model manipulation, and cascading threats in multi‑layer API orchestrations—intensify the need for advanced protective controls, including mTLS, OAuth 2.1, and zero‑trust governance architectures. A key contribution of this work is a taxonomy that classifies AI‑driven API ecosystems according to autonomy level, governance maturity, interoperability, security posture, and energy efficiency. The review positions APIs as foundational components of intelligent systems and offers guidance for research, standardization efforts, and the secure deployment of AI‑native API architectures.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2220901075", "name": "F.

Yapay zekâ; alt teknolojiler aracılığıyla tanı, prognoz, tedavi ve psiko-eğitim süreçlerinde\ngiderek daha yaygın kullanılmaktadır.

There is limited information regarding the views of patients on AI in healthcare. The aim of our study was to assess the views of patients on the use of AI in healthcare with an on-site questionnaire. Patients in our tertiary hospital with a diagnostic imaging appointment were invited to complete a paper-based questionnaire between December 2022 and October 2023. We asked about socio-demographic data, experience, knowledge, and their opinion on the use of AI in healthcare, focusing on the fields (1) diagnostics, (2) therapy, and (3) triage. Out of a total of 198 patients (mean age 49.41 ± 17.6 years, 99 female), 91.5% stated that they expected benefits from the implementation of AI in healthcare, although 73.4% rated their knowledge of AI as moderate to none. The majority of patients were in favour of using AI in diagnostics (87.2%) and therapy (73.1%), while only 28.2% approved its use in patient triage. 84.0% wanted to be informed about the use of AI in at least one of the mentioned areas. Participants with higher education, higher self-assessed knowledge of AI and personal experience with AI showed greater approval for AI in healthcare. Our interviewed patients have a rather open attitude towards AI in healthcare, with differentiated views depending on the topic; patients are in favour of the use of AI, especially in diagnostics and to a lesser extent also for therapy support, but they reject its use for triage. Overall, the results emphasise the need for widespread efforts to address patient concerns about AI in healthcare, including enhancing understanding and acceptance while protecting marginalised groups. This will help clinical radiology to adopt AI more effectively. There is limited information on patients’ views of AI in healthcare, often focused on specific groups, limiting generalizability. Patients are open to AI in healthcare, supporting its use in diagnostics and therapy, but rejecting its use for triage. Overall, patients want to be informed about AI usage and participants with higher education and AI experience showed more approval.

These challenges include evaluation criteria being too one-dimensional, over-emphasis on quantitative research, inadequate monitoring and feedback. This paper develops the author’s previous research on teacher performance evaluation reforms at the undergraduate level in Anhui Province. This paper attempts to identify ways AI can be used in teacher performance evaluation to support and facilitate the improvement of strategic, evaluative, and developmental alignment and performance evaluation reforms.\nMethodology/approach: The study relies on a mixed-methods approach rooted in the theories of strategic human resource management. First, a systematic review of the literature, both domestic and global, on teacher performance evaluations, AI in educational management, and strategic human resource management. Second, an AI performance evaluation model is created by adapting an existing strategy-oriented performance evaluation framework for undergraduate educators in Anhui Province and incorporating data analytics, intelligent performance evaluation, and multi-source performance evaluation systems. The evaluation of the proposed model relies on empirical data collected using teacher questionnaires from some undergraduate institutions in Anhui Province, utilizing various statistical techniques such as reliability and validity analyses and structural equation modeling.\nOriginality/Relevance: Use of smart data analysis and multi-faceted assessment tools mitigate the overemphasis on research output metrics and encourage a more holistic and equitable recognition of teaching, research, and community service contributions. Employees experience greater feelings of equity and motivation to perform under the AI evaluative structure. This research examines the evaluation of university faculty using artificial intelligence as a strategic resource management tool in the higher education system. The study responds to a national policy requirement to eliminate the ‘five-only’ framework of evaluation and the current evaluations in undergraduate colleges in Anhui Province, which are described as evaluative, disappointing to teachers, and lacking feedback. Teacher evaluation with AI shows promise in improving objectivity, accuracy, and a developmental focus in evaluation.\n \nKey findings: The findings indicate that AI can close the gap between the university’s strategic goals and the individual aims of the faculty, enhance the accuracy and justifiability of evaluation criteria, and strengthen evaluation criteria and systems for feedback and sustained improvement.\n \nTheoretical/methodological contributions: The integration of artificial intelligence and the theories of strategic human resource management and performance evaluation gives rise to a new theory in the management of higher education. The new theory is the foundation of the construction of a systematic AI evaluative structure, which is a valuable and unique contribution of this work. The systematic AI evaluative structure, which is based on the principles of goal management, competence-driven evaluative criteria, and intelligent feedback systems, is an empirically proven model for transformative reform of the evaluative frameworks of teacher performance in higher education, especially in institutions in Anhui Province.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2406582586", "name": "Song Jiao", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "13843372", "name": "Sururi Sururi", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2406580549", "name": "Aan Komariah", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "66414798", "name": "T.

Penggunaan AI dalam transaksi dagang semakin meluas dan kompleks, namun pengaturannya dalam sistem hukum nasional masih belum memadai. Untuk menjawab persoalan tersebut, penelitian ini menggunakan metode yuridis normatif dengan pendekatan konseptual dan komparatif. Data dikumpulkan melalui studi kepustakaan terhadap bahan hukum primer seperti Kitab Undang-Undang Hukum Dagang, Kitab Undang-Undang Hukum Perdata, Undang-Undang Informasi dan Transaksi Elektronik (UU No. 11 Tahun 2008), Undang-Undang Perlindungan Konsumen (UU No. 8 Tahun 1999), serta Peraturan Pemerintah No. 71 Tahun 2019 tentang Penyelenggaraan Sistem dan Transaksi Elektronik, disertai bahan hukum sekunder yang relevan. Analisis dilakukan secara kualitatif untuk menafsirkan norma yang berlaku dan mengidentifikasi kekosongan maupun kelemahan regulasi dalam konteks perdagangan digital berbasis Artificial Intelligence. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa hukum dagang Indonesia belum mengatur secara eksplisit kedudukan, kapasitas hukum, dan tanggung jawab sistem kecerdasan buatan dalam aktivitas dagang, sehingga menimbulkan potensi ketidakpastian dan sengketa bagi para pelaku usaha maupun konsumen.

Standard weight-based dosing may result in either subtherapeutic exposure or toxicity. Machine learning (ML) models can capture complex relationships among clinical variables and support individualized therapy. Methods We analyzed clinical and pharmacokinetic data from 20 pediatric patients enrolled in the PUERI study (January 2020–November 2021, ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda, Milan, Italy). Eight ML models-including linear regression (LR), ridge regression (RR), lasso regression (LaR), Huber regression (HR), random forest (RF), XGBoost, LightGBM, and a neural network (MLP)-were trained to predict ceftaroline doses that would achieve plasma concentrations close to the therapeutic target of 10 mg/L. Model performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and the coefficient of determination (R2). To ensure interpretability, we applied local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) to identify the most influential predictors of dose. Results MLP (MAE 1.53 mg, R2 0.94) and XGBoost (MAE 2.04 mg, R2 0.89) outperformed linear models. Predicted doses were more frequently aligned with therapeutic concentrations than those clinically administered. Model-based simulated concentrations fell within the therapeutic range in approximately 85% of cases, and the best ML models showed over 90% patient-level clinical. RF, LightGBM and XGBoost achieved the highest clinical alignment, with 94.2, 92.4 and 91.5% of patients reaching therapeutic levels. Renal function markers, such as serum creatinine and azotemia, together with anthropometric parameters including weight, height, and body mass index, were consistently the most influential features. Conclusion Advanced ML models can optimize ceftaroline dosing in pediatric patients and outperform traditional dosing strategies. Combining predictive accuracy with interpretability (via LIME) supports clinical trust and may enhance precision antibiotic therapy while reducing the risks of antimicrobial resistance and toxicity.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2277215513", "name": "Maria Frasca", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2112802466", "name": "Gianluca Gazzaniga", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2355891841", "name": "Agnese Graziosi", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2313853916", "name": "Valentina De Nicolò", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2169391728", "name": "Costantino De Giacomo", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2238651456", "name": "S.

Many fresh graduates face a skills mismatch, as traditional curricula lag behind industry needs, requiring not only technical knowledge but also critical thinking, problem-solving, and adaptability. This study aims to analyze the effects of AI Knowledge and Job Market Awareness on Fresh Graduates’ Quality with Employability Skills as a mediating variable. This research adopts a quantitative approach using a survey method. Data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares–Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to examine the relationships among the research variables. This study finds that AI Knowledge and Job Market Awareness positively and significantly influence Employability Skills and Fresh Graduates’ Quality. Employability Skills have a direct effect on graduate quality and also mediate the effects of AI Knowledge and Job Market Awareness, indicating that skill development is the main pathway through which technological understanding and labor market awareness enhance graduates’ work readiness and overall quality. Based on the findings, students are encouraged to strengthen their critical evaluation skills when using AI tools, develop a more realistic understanding of job market conditions, enhance their ability to assess the accuracy and relevance of digital information, and consistently demonstrate ethical and responsible behavior in academic and professional activities.

Its applications extend across diagnosis, planning, intraoperative assistance, postoperative monitoring, rehabilitation, prosthetics and education.\n\n\nAPPLICATIONS\nIn diagnostic imaging, AI improves the detection of distal radius and scaphoid fractures, estimates osteoporosis from hand radiographs, identifies triangular fibrocartilage complex injuries on magnetic resonance imaging, segments bones and cartilage, and supports dynamic wrist analysis; ultrasound- and neurophysiological-based models aid carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosis. Prognostic models predict outcomes after carpal tunnel release and thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis with mixed performance. Pre- and intraoperative applications include large language model-based triage and coding, navigation and phase/gesture recognition from surgical video, autonomous microsurgical prototypes and telemanipulator platforms for supermicrosurgery. Artificial intelligence-enabled telemonitoring (e.g. remote photoplethysmography) and video-based mobility tracking support postoperative care and rehabilitation.

At present, most artificial intelligence systems are still categorized as narrow AI, capable of performing only specific and well-defined tasks. To move toward more general intelligence, a promising approach is through collective collaboration among multiple narrow AIs. However, the uncontrolled growth of such systems could pose significant risks in the future. To mitigate these risks, we propose the implementation of an artificial prefrontal cortex mechanism within the collaborative framework of narrow AIs. This mechanism functions as both a safety controller and a task switcher, determining which narrow AI should be activated for a given context. Through this architecture, the collaborative system may evolve toward adaptive and safe general intelligence, which is capable of coordination and reasoning, yet constrained by ethical and operational safeguards.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2405697076", "name": "Rachmad Imam Tarecha", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2337130719", "name": "Priska Choirina", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2405697096", "name": "Urnika Mudhifatul Jannah", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2405698006", "name": "Bagus Seta Inba Cipta", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2405698203", "name": "Pangestuti Prima Darajat", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2405698041", "name": "Amalia Agung Septarina", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

We call this phenomenon Artificial Jagged Intelligence (AJI). This paper develops a tractable economic model of AJI that treats adoption as an information problem: users care about \\emph{local} reliability, but typically observe only coarse, global quality signals. In a baseline one-dimensional landscape, truth is a rough Brownian process, and the model ``knows''scattered points drawn from a Poisson process. The model interpolates optimally, and the local error is measured by posterior variance. We derive an adoption threshold for a blind user, show that experienced errors are amplified by the inspection paradox, and interpret scaling laws as denser coverage that improves average quality without eliminating jaggedness. We then study mastery and calibration: a calibrated user who can condition on local uncertainty enjoys positive expected value even in domains that fail the blind adoption test. Modelling mastery as learning a reliability map via Gaussian process regression yields a learning-rate bound driven by information gain, clarifying when discovering ``where the model works''is slow. Finally, we study how scaling interacts with discoverability: when calibrated signals and user mastery accelerate the harvesting of scale improvements, and when opacity can make gains from scaling effectively invisible.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2270755268", "name": "Joshua Gans", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": ["Economics", "Computer Science"]}

The Machine Perturbational Complexity & Agency Battery (mPCAB) introduces a new, substrate-independent framework that applies neurophysiological methods used initially to assess consciousness in artificial systems. Unlike existing evaluations, it features four key components—perturbational complexity, global workspace assessment, norm internalization, and agency—that link mechanisms with functions. This enables systematic comparisons across digital, neuromorphic, and biological substrates, addressing three research gaps: long-term reasoning with coherent behavior, norm internalization amid distribution shifts, and transformational creativity involving meta-cognitive rule modification. By analyzing theories of consciousness (GNW, IIT, PP, HOT), we identify targets for AI implementation. Our cognitive architecture analysis maps human functions—such as working memory and executive control—to their computational counterparts, providing guiding principles for design. The creativity taxonomy progresses from combinational to transformational, with measurable criteria like changes in conceptual space and the depth of meta-level reasoning. Ethical considerations are integrated into frameworks for monitoring organoid intelligence, reducing bias in creativity, and addressing rights issues. Pilot studies demonstrate mPCAB’s feasibility across different substrates and show that its metrics are comparable.

Spectrum sensing, a cornerstone of CR and SI, is critical for identifying underutilized frequency bands and mitigating interference. Traditional methods often struggle in dynamic environments due to their reliance on static models. By combining AGI’s adaptive decision-making with LLMs’ context-aware understanding, the integrated system can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of spectrum sensing. This integration enables better processing of diverse data, prediction of spectrum usage, and dynamic adaptation to changing conditions, paving the way for intelligent spectrum management.

Objective: To evaluate the role of artificial intelligence in medical imaging, analyzing its ability to complement or replace professionals in interpreting medical studies. Also, to identify the advantages, limitations, and impact of AI in modern radiology. Method: A systematic literature review was conducted on the use of artificial intelligence in medical imaging, focusing on studies from the last 5 years. The search included articles from high-impact scientific journals. Results: Artificial intelligence has demonstrated performance similar to that of radiologists in interpreting images of common pathologies. However, its clinical implementation faces several challenges, such as the need for large volumes of high-quality data and the difficulty of addressing complex clinical situations. Additionally, the importance of human supervision in decision-making and contextual image interpretation is emphasized, as AI cannot fully replicate this.

However, ensuring users’ quality of experience (QoE) under resource-constrained conditions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce a cross-modal semantic communication transmission scheme for mobile-AIGPV. This scheme generates low-resolution panoramic videos on the edge server and transmits them via cross-modal semantic communication. Furthermore, to better ensure users’ QoE, we propose a panoramic video super-resolution transmission framework based on deep joint source-channel coding (JSCC), named PVSR-JSCC. This framework leverages neural networks (NNs) and attention mechanisms to achieve semantic extraction and adaptive variable-length coding, and performs feature cyclic enhancement based on the motion and context, thereby achieving the panoramic video super-resolution task. Additionally, we design a cross-modal swin transformer block (CMSTB) to enhance the deep JSCC performance. The CMSTB integrates self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms, enabling deep JSCC to capture the intrinsic semantic correlation between text and video.

Conventional channel estimation approaches encounter significant scalability limitations in emerging scenarios, such as high-mobility environments, extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) configurations, and multi-band operations, where pilot overhead grows dramatically. CSI extrapolation offers an effective solution to these issues by leveraging limited or partial CSI measurements to reconstruct or predict the full CSI, thereby substantially lowering the required overhead without compromising accuracy. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool to advance CSI extrapolation, enabling more accurate and efficient inference across diverse channel conditions. Although research in this area is expanding rapidly, the literature still lacks a thorough and unified survey that synthesizes the latest developments in AI-based CSI extrapolation methods. This paper aims to bride this gap by providing the first comprehensive review of AI-driven CSI extrapolation techniques, covering their current state, key limitations, and promising research avenues. We begin by outlining the foundational aspects of AI-driven CSI extrapolation. This includes essential wireless channel properties that influence extrapolation performance and an overview of the most commonly employed AI architectures suited to this task. Building on these basics, we systematically examine the major categories of extrapolation approaches, both traditional model-based and modern AI-enhanced ones, across the primary domains: time, frequency, antenna, and multi-domain scenarios. For each category, we highlight representative techniques, their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations, along with distilled insights from comparative studies. Recognizing the strong potential of AI-based methods to satisfy the demanding performance targets of future systems, we also review publicly available open channel datasets and channel simulators that support the development and benchmarking of robust AI-driven extrapolation models.

Despite their remarkable capabilities in generating content, these models encounter substantial challenges when producing structured outputs and engaging in dynamic interactions, particularly when they need to retrieve external information in real time. To address these limitations, researchers have developed the ”Function Calling” paradigm. This approach enables language models to analyze user inquiries and engage with defined functions, thereby facilitating precise responses through connections to external sources, including databases, programming interfaces, and live data streams. This functionality has been successfully implemented across numerous sectors such as finance analytics, healthcare systems, and service operations. The implementation of function calling comprises three essential phases: preparation, execution, and processing. The preparation phase encompasses query analysis and function identification. During execution, the system evaluates whether a function is necessary, extracts relevant parameters, and oversees the operation. The processing phase concentrates on analyzing outcomes and crafting appropriate responses. Each phase presents unique difficulties, ranging from accurately selecting functions to managing complex parameter extraction and ensuring reliable execution. Researchers have established various evaluation frameworks and metrics to assess function calling performance, including success rates, computational efficiency, parameter extraction accuracy, and response quality indicators such as ROUGE-L evaluation scores. This survey systematically reviews the current landscape of function calling in LLMs, analyzing technical challenges, examining existing solutions, and discussing evaluation methodologies.

However, existing SFL frameworks would frequently upload smashed data and download gradients between the server and each client, leading to severe communication overheads. To address this issue, this work proposes a novel communication-and-computation efficient SFL framework, which allows dynamic model splitting (server- and client-side model cutting point selection) and broadcasting of aggregated smashed data gradients. We theoretically analyze the impact of the cutting point selection on the convergence rate, revealing that model splitting with a smaller client-side model size leads to a better convergence performance and vise versa. Based on the above insights, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the model convergence rate and latency under the consideration of data privacy via a joint Cutting point selection, Communication and Computation resource allocation (CCC) strategy. To deal with the proposed mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization problem, we develop an algorithm by integrating the Double Deep Q-learning Network (DDQN) with convex optimization methods.

However, to facilitate specialized generative edge intelligence in dynamic UV networks, GAI models need to tap into local data and conduct online fine-tuning, and the dispersed distribution of UVs makes distributed fine-tuning paradigms crucial. Although the federated generative model fine-tuning brings a potential solution, the large number of parameter transmissions involved in its fine-tuning process are often constrained by communication bottlenecks, which are more pronounced for resource-constrained UV networks. To cope with these challenges, we introduce an energy-efficient GAI model fine-tuning framework for the hierarchical UV networks, which employs over-the-air technology to save computational resource costs for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) during federated aggregation within a federated learning paradigm. Thereafter, we study the resource allocation problem in the fine-tuning process of the generative model and formulate a joint optimization problem for the bandwidth allocation, power control, computation resource allocation, and denoising factor control, aiming to minimize the system energy consumption. Then, we decouple the original problem into four tractable subproblems, and propose a block coordinate descent algorithm to solve them iteratively. Particularly, we derive a closed-form solution for the denoising factor to minimize the local model uploading transmission energy consumption under a specific AirComp communication error threshold.

This study adopts a twofold critical–constructive approach to examine GenAI’s role in reproducing epistemic hierarchies and to advance pathways toward more equitable use in education. Using a critical constructive qualitative design, we first conducted zero-shot prompt testing with ChatGPT-4 Turbo and Gemini 1.5 models across contexts in the Global North and Global South. The models responses were documented in real time and analyzed through a critical interpretive lens to surface patterns associated with digital neocolonialism. The critical phase of the study identifies six interconnected dimensions through which GenAI sustains Western dominance in educational contexts: Western curriculum ideologies, cultural imperialism, pedagogical control, language marginalization, racial and ethnic underrepresentation, and access inequity. For instance, when Gemini was asked to identify the seasons in the United States and Ghana, it returned the same four-season framework for both contexts, reflecting Western climatological assumptions. Across other prompts, GenAI outputs relied on stereotypical imagery, assumed Western-centered instructional resources, limited Indigenous and local language support, and disproportionately represented Western racial identities. In addition, subscription-based pricing models create structural barriers, as educators and institutions in much of the Global South face disproportionate costs due to currency differences. Building directly on these findings, the constructive phase advances two mitigation pathways for equitable GenAI in education. The first pathway targets AI design, emphasizing liberatory design methods, foresight by design, and the decentralization of GenAI development to strengthen local participation and data sovereignty. The second operates at the pedagogical level, advancing a human-centric prompt engineering model that empowers educators to contextualize prompts, critically interrogate outputs, and exercise pedagogical agency.

However, their rapidly increasing parameter sizes lead to significant communication and computational overhead, posing challenges to the energy efficiency (EEF) and memory footprint of AI processors. Compute-in-memory (CIM) architecture has emerged as a promising solution to alleviate bandwidth constraints and improve EEF. Nonetheless, both integer (INT) and floating-point (FP) CIM implementations struggle with the trade-off between accuracy and memory requirement when applied to LLMs. Outlier-aware quantization (OAQ), which employs low-precision formats for normal values and retains FP formats for high-magnitude outliers, has proven effective in matching the accuracy of full-FP baselines and has become a mainstream approach for efficient LLM deployment. Therefore, this work presents OA-CIM, an SRAM-based digital CIM macro that facilitates element-wise hybrid processing of BF16 outliers and INT4 normal values. The major contributions are: 1) an LUT-based multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) circuit design, which supports efficient FP/INT-compatible (FIC) MAC operations; 2) an xor-sharing non-maximum exponent gating scheme that reduces latency and area by bypassing unnecessary exponent comparisons in FP dataflow; and 3) a sparsity-aware readout circuit with distribution-offset weight encoding (DOWE) to mitigate the power-intensive charging/discharging process on the bitline. A 22-nm 512-kB 8T SRAM OA-CIM prototype is fabricated, which achieves an EEF of 346.6 TOPS/W in INT4 mode and 249.5 TFLOPS/W in outlier mode, representing a $2.7{\\times }$ to $3.1{\\times }$ improvement over state-of-the-art mixed-precision CIMs.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2193135223", "name": "Siqi He", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "28918074", "name": "Haozhe Zhu", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2193093734", "name": "Hongyi Zhang", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2364050397", "name": "Yujie Ma", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2349114361", "name": "Zexing Chen", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2221253181", "name": "Mengjie Li", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2126978524", "name": "Danfeng Zhai", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2241935225", "name": "Chixiao Chen", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2144831923", "name": "Qi Liu", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2238547053", "name": "Xiaoyang Zeng", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2257342756", "name": "Ming Liu", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

To this end, this paper presents a Deterministic Communication, Computation, and Control (Det3C) integration network architecture, which is composed of four layers, i.e., end, edge, core, and cloud layers. Specifically, the distributed ICPS domains of end layers are responsible for local training of AIGC models. The updated model parameters are aggregated in edge severs and then transmitted to a cloud sever for global aggregation through wide-area core networks. Besides, we adopt a cyclic queuing and forwarding (CQF) mechanism and design an enhanced cycle specified queuing and forwarding (E-CSQF) mechanism to ensure the deterministic transmission of parameter flows. To obtain optimal ICPS domain selection and computing and temporal (i.e., queue) resource allocation decisions for flow processing and transmission, we formulate a joint optimization problem with the objective to minimize the overall delay of AIGC models. Due to complicated coupled constraints among decisions, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based cross-domain computing orchestration scheme is proposed to reduce computing delay and a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based deterministic flow scheduling scheme is designed to optimize transmission delay while improving scheduling success ratio.

Despite significant advancements, FL-based modulation decoding faces two primary challenges: (1) Vulnerability to noisy environments - Current studies often prioritize high-quality datasets during training to ensure model performance, which often results in overfitting since real-world signals involve a wide range of noise levels from various sources. (2) Model divergence in non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) environments - The aggregation step in a conventional FL leads to divergence on a large federated scale, resulting in the loss of local-specific knowledge. Moreover, existing FL-based modulation decoding studies typically focus on a single non-IID issue, which limits their ability to generalize across large-scale heterogeneous settings. To address these challenges, we propose FedVaccine, a framework that enhances model generalization across diverse noise conditions and non-IID data environments. Instead of relying on high-quality datasets that risk overfitting, FedVaccine employs a harmonic noise resilience approach—akin to a vaccination effect—that deliberately exposes the model to controlled noise, identifying noise tolerance, regularizing training, and ensuring robust decoding performance across varying noise levels. Additionally, FedVaccine incorporates a Federated Split Learning approach to cumulatively update the global model, ensuring adaptive recalibration and mitigating the loss of local knowledge during aggregation. Furthermore, a localized support set is used to ensure effective personalization. Experimental results demonstrate that FedVaccine outperforms existing FL-based modulation classification models and other learning paradigms in both IID and non-IID scenarios using public datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in practical deployment scenarios across wireless networks.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2298212072", "name": "Hunmin Lee", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2326111807", "name": "Hongju Seong", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2298205990", "name": "Jihun Bae", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2326351919", "name": "Wonbin Kim", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2327731618", "name": "Hyeokchan Kwon", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2347180678", "name": "Youngsoo Kim", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2326114596", "name": "Daehee Seo", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science"]}

The development and application of artificial intelligence have greatly enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of AMR. However, existing deep learning-based models typically design intricate backbone networks to extract deep features of signals. Moreover, the training of networks relies on supervised information, and the number of samples is crucial to model performance. This paper proposes a masked transformer model for AMR (MTAMR), comprising two stages: mask training and fine-tuning. The signal is preprocessed into in-phase orthogonal, amplitude phase, and Fourier transform vectors, and then concatenated into a multimodal sequence to obtain a more efficient representation. In the mask training stage, the multimodal sequence is masked by random zeroing, and global features are extracted through the Transformer encoder. Subsequently, these features are processed by two methods to obtain the prediction sequence and classification probability. Considering the homogeneous uncertainty of the prediction and classification tasks, a joint loss with learnable weights is constructed. In the fine-tuning stage, the unmasked multimodal sequence is taken as input, and the cross-entropy loss with a low learning rate is used to update the model. Simulation results show that MTAMR with a simple backbone structure, achieves significant recognition accuracy on multiple datasets by leveraging mask modeling and multimodal fusion representation, while the computational complexity is feasible.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2326532238", "name": "Weisi Kong", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2150444432", "name": "Xun Jiao", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2213641841", "name": "Yuhua Xu", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2238057121", "name": "Qinghai Yang", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science"]}

Namely, the incorporation of such systems will engender subtle but significant changes to the state’s deliberative and organisational structures, its culture, and its capacities – and in ways that could undermine its adherence to international norms of restraint. In offering this provocation, we argue that the gradual proliferation and embeddedness of AI-enabled decision-support systems within the state – what we call the ‘phenomenon of “Borgs in the org”’ – will lead to four significant changes that, together, threaten to diminish the state’s crucial capacity for ‘institutional learning’. Specifically, the state’s reliance on AI-enabled decision-support systems in deliberations over war initiation will invite: (i) disrupted deliberative structures and chains of command; (ii) the occlusion of crucial steps in decision-making processes; (iii) institutionalised deference to computer-generated outputs; and (iv) future plans and trajectories that are overdetermined by past policies and actions. The resulting ‘institutional atrophy’ could, in turn, weaken the state’s responsiveness to external social cues and censure, thereby making the state less likely to engage with, internalise, and adhere to evolving international norms of restraint. As a collateral effect, this weakening could contribute to the decay of these norms themselves if such institutional atrophy were to become widespread within the society of states.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2300235134", "name": "Toni Erskine", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2407435526", "name": "Jenny L.

Then, to achieve the efficient learning of GSC models deployed on each user, a Personalized Semantic Federated Learning (PSFL) framework is proposed. Specifically, in the local training phase, a Personalized Local Distillation (PLD) approach is employed, where each user selects a tailored GSC model as a mentor based on local resources. This mentor subsequently distills knowledge to a unified student model, ensuring compliance with the model isomorphism requirements of FL. In the global aggregation phase, an Adaptive Global Pruning (AGP) scheme is applied, dynamically pruning or expanding the aggregated global model based on real-time channel conditions.

This triggered demand for antitrust activism. A similar dynamic is visible in today’s second Gilded Age, this time in the context of the data-driven economy based on the nexus of big data, machine learning and artificial intelligence. The scaling up of markets through globalization turned out to be the answer to the social and political issues raised by scale economies in the first Gilded Age. Technological change may yet be the answer to the social and political issues emerging in the second Gilded Age. However, the proliferation of firms developing AI-enabled applications has not translated into a commensurate diffusion of economic or political power. Control over the foundational layers of machine knowledge capital — training data at scale, frontier models, compute infrastructure and algorithmic distribution channels — remains highly concentrated. At the same time, the political economy is evolving in a direction antithetical to antitrust enforcement; antitrust activism as a response to the excesses of the data-driven economy has been subordinated to geopolitics. The concentration of economic power through rent capture has been compounded by the concentration of narrative authority. In short, the gilding on the new Gilded Age is thickening, not eroding. Antitrust is an instrument of the state — and the very nature of the state is now an open question in the face of transformational technological change. ", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "93459437", "name": "Dan Ciuriak", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

It argues that modern AI systems, particularly in their statistical and data-centric forms, are not merely instrumental tools but expressions of a deeper metaphysical worldview-one rooted in quantification, abstraction, and utility. Guénon’s critique of the “reign of quantity” and Heidegger’s notion of Enframing (Gestell) converge in diagnosing the loss of qualitative and sacred dimensions in modern life. While Heidegger’s phenomenology provides a powerful immanent critique of technological reductionism from within the Western philosophical tradition, Guénon’s metaphysical traditionalism articulates a diagnosis of modernity that resonates with Islamic metaphysics, especially as articulated by Ibn al-ʿArabī. The essay includes Heidegger in the argument as a representative of a critique of modern technology issuing from the Western tradition itself, and by emphasizing his shared concerns with Guénon, whose metaphysics resonates with Ibn al-ʿArabī’s metaphysics. Through a comparative metaphysical framework, this paper proposes an Islamic response to AI that avoids both technophilia and technophobia, insisting instead on a spiritually grounded ethic of technology that preserves human’s dignity and mission. Methodologically, the essay restores a prior order often inverted in contemporary AI ethics: ontology (what AI is) grounds epistemology (what it can know), and only then can ethical evaluation be coherent.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2317898031", "name": "Boumediene Hamzi", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

Accurate traffic prediction is crucial for reducing congestion, improving travel efficiency, and enhancing traffic safety. However, the complex and dynamically changing spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic networks make the prediction task highly challenging. Most existing methods rely on self-attention mechanisms to capture these spatio-temporal dependencies, which often result in high computational complexity. Furthermore, although traffic systems can be modeled as graph structures, graph convolutional network (GCN), which effectively capture correlations between nodes, typically depend on predefined or adaptive adjacency matrices. These approaches struggle to cope with the highly dynamic nature of real-world traffic systems. To address these issues, we propose a spatio-temporal mamba dynamic graph convolutional recurrent neural network (STMAGRN). This model first leverages the mamba framework to extract spatio-temporal features from traffic sequences. The mamba model, through its unique selective state space mechanism and linear time complexity, achieves efficient sequence processing. Next, we design a spatio-temporal memory module (STM), which identifies and extracts traffic pattern features most similar to the input data, and learns intrinsic representative traffic patterns from the data associated with each node. These patterns are then used to dynamically generate graph structures, providing GCN with real-time updated graph data. Finally, we combine GCN with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to extract both spatial and temporal features simultaneously. We conducted extensive experiments on six real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that STMAGRN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in traffic prediction tasks.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2115795460", "name": "Xiaoyan Zhang", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2333531232", "name": "Yongqin Zhang", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2315479217", "name": "Xiangfu Meng", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science"]}

Rapid response to multiple landslide events demands accurate, all-weather, day-and-night detection capabilities. Optical remote sensing has advanced landslide detection but remains limited under adverse weather and lighting conditions. Synthetic Aperture Radar, resilient to these constraints, remains underexplored for automated landslide detection due to challenges such as complex pre-processing and geometric distortions. This study integrates Deep Neural Networks with Sentinel-1 backscatter data for co-seismic landslide detection, utilizing a data-centric approach. We train and test the models using 11 earthquake-induced widespread landslide events, covering ≈ 73 000 landslides across diverse geologic and climatic settings. Inference on unseen events in Haiti (2021) and Sumatra (2022) demonstrates robust transferability, achieving F1-scores up to 82 %. Using explainable artificial intelligence, we highlight the discriminative capability of change detection bands over backscatter alone. Our findings emphasize the potential of SAR-based DNN models for worldwide, generalized, and rapid landslide detection, addressing critical gaps in current methods that solely use optical data.

The challenge is how to choose an inference routing in which both the transmission and inference can be efficiently relayed hop-by-hop.

To address the complexities of heterogeneous task structures and dynamic collaboration, the article first introduces a multisource heterogeneous task scheduling mechanism, which optimizes task prioritization and resource allocation for efficient processing. In addition, a decentralized reinforcement learning approach based on partial reward decoupling (PRD) heterogeneous agent proximal policy optimization (PRD-HAPPO) is employed to enhance collaboration and trajectory planning between UAVs and vehicles.

As Peter Norvig states, “Somewhat remarkably, almost all AI research until very recently has assumed that the performance measure can be exactly and correctly specified in the form of a utility or reward function” [S. J. Russell and P. Norvig, Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Pearson, 2020)]. Once the reward function is known, any problem can be formulated as an optimization or search problem—the areas well explored within the AI community. However, while the long-term objectives of a specific activity are often well defined, constructing short-term rewards that remain aligned with those goals and consistent with real-world constraints remains a major unresolved challenge. Such alignment has been achieved in domains such as chess, Go, and supervised machine learning problems, where objectives are well defined and easily simulated. However, no universal solution exists for defining intermediate rewards for complex, evolving scientific goals, which remains an open challenge. Correspondingly, the key to operationalizing automated instruments, integrating multi-instrument self-driving laboratories, and building geographically distributed research facilities is to generate experiment-aligned, probabilistic, domain-specific reward functions. These rewards must be consistent with long-term experimental objectives while remaining actionable on the timescales of decision-making on laboratory tools in microscopy and materials synthesis labs—proper reward definition operationalizes scientific intent. Here, we review the extant reward structures in the physical sciences and summarize opportunities for reward design informed by physical principles, human heuristics, and LLM-based reasoning.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2322954710", "name": "Sergei V.

Objective This study aimed to design, implement, and validate an artificial intelligence–driven framework that fuses multimodal pediatric data and leverages advanced natural language processing and ensemble learning to improve early, accurate stratification of key pediatric health risks. Methods A retrospective dataset of over 40,000 pediatric participants aged 2‐8 years was used to train and evaluate the framework. Data were split into training, validation, and test sets (70%, 15%, and 15%, respectively) with a temporally mindful partitioning strategy to approximate prospective evaluation. Baseline comparators included traditional statistical and machine learning models, and the statistical significance of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) differences was assessed using the DeLong test. Results The proposed Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers–based model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.85 (95% CI 0.82‐0.88), sensitivity of 0.78, specificity of 0.80, and F1-score of 0.75 on the test set, outperforming multiple baseline models. In an additional manual comparison evaluation, automated and expert assessments aligned with 78% accuracy (78/100), and most discrepancies arose in “equivalent” cases. Conclusions This study provides a validated, artificial intelligence–driven, multimodal pediatric health risk stratification framework that translates heterogeneous child health data into clinically actionable risk profiles, demonstrating strong discriminative performance and meaningful agreement with expert assessment. The framework supports proactive, individualized pediatric care and offers a scalable foundation for further validation across broader populations and longitudinal follow-up.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2407768111", "name": "Zhihe Mao", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2407107164", "name": "Jundan Chen", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": ["Medicine"]}

This paper explored what effect AI has on cognitive independence, critical thinking, and linguistic creativity in learners and the ethical and pedagogical issues, such as academic dishonesty and teacher functions. The type of research design was quantitative and the sample comprised 250 undergraduate and graduate students and English language teachers in various institutions of higher learning through the administration of a structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to investigate the relationships between AI dependency and critical learning outcomes, reliability analysis, Pearson correlation, and multiple regression analyses were performed. The results showed that AI dependency in higher degrees was strongly related to the decreased cognitive autonomy, less critical thinking, and less linguistic creativity, and it caused the concern about academic integrity. Filed by teachers, there were changes in their teaching duties to suit AI application. The research comes to the conclusion that AI in ELLT is a two-sided instrument: it helps people learn, but it can also negatively influence cognitive growth, creativity, and ethical behaviour.

Here, in this Review, we outline sophisticated computational frameworks, particularly leveraging artificial intelligence, to bridge this gap. We detail the integration of diverse data resources, including disease-specific omics, EV, protein localization, tissue-specific, drug, model system and immune databases. This Review comprehensively describes computational selection strategies, from rule-based sequential filtering to advanced machine learning for data fusion and deep learning for multi-omics integration. Crucially, it discusses the refinement of biomarker candidates using artificial-intelligence-driven predictions of protein structure and physicochemical properties, ensuring compatibility with existing assay systems. By systematically evaluating biomarkers for predictive performance, biological plausibility and clinical utility, this framework aims to accelerate the transition of EV research from discovery to clinical application, thereby enhancing precision medicine. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanosized particles released by cells, carrying RNA, proteins and lipids. They hold promise as noninvasive markers for diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. However, using EVs in clinical settings is challenging. Many candidate markers identified in research do not work well with current testing methods. In 2021 alone, over 1,000 studies on EV markers were published, but only 4 were clinically validated. This Review emphasizes the need for advanced computational tools to identify clinically viable markers. The authors discuss various data resources and computational strategies, including artificial intelligence approaches that predict protein structures, interactions and assay compatibility to prioritize candidates.

This study introduces SysFungiNet, a unified, FAIR-compliant systems-bioinformatics framework designed to accelerate bioactives discovery in non-model fungi. Unlike existing pipelines, SysFungiNet integrates LC-MS/MS metabolomics, transcriptomics, and genomic data with explainable artificial intelligence and molecular docking validation. By reconstructing biosynthetic pathways for Ganoderma lucidum and Craterellus cornucopioides, the framework achieved a Pathway Completeness Index of 0.86. An ensemble machine-learning model predicted bioactivity with an F1-score of 0.91, identifying 312 annotated metabolites. Crucially, decision-making was transparent, with SHAP analysis identifying specific chemical substructures driving predicted immunomodulation. The framework prioritized five high-confidence candidates, including a putative novel terpenoid, Cornucopiolide, which showed high binding affinity (−9.4 kcal/mol) to human immune receptors in silico. Benchmarking against MetaFungi and PhytoOmics demonstrated superior annotation accuracy and reproducibility.

Wireless large artificial intelligence model (WLAM), as a pivotal technology, leverages deep semantic awareness together with intelligent inference and decision-making capabilities to drive the evolution of applications in artificial intelligent internet of things (AIoT). However, despite the unprecedented efficiency, native intelligence, and seamless connectivity of 6G, deploying WLAM in AIoT environment remains challenging due to limited computational resource of edge terminals, communication bottlenecks from billion-scale parameters, and privacy trade-off. In response, we propose a hierarchical split federated learning framework assisted by edge intelligence of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), called federated learning via aerial splitting hierarchy (FLASH), to help computing offloading of client-side through aerial nodes. The framework jointly optimizes model splitting layers, client-UAV pairing, and computational resource allocation of UAVs. Then, we formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem with objectives of weighted averages of single-round training latency and client energy consumption, subject to UAV energy and computational resource constraints. To solve the complex joint optimization problem, we formalize this problem as a markov decision process (MDP) and design a distributed synchronous deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on proximal policy optimization, achieving efficient joint resource scheduling through parallel training and synchronous policy updates.

However, existing approaches often rely on explicit action exchange between agents to evaluate action value functions, which is frequently impractical in real-world engineering environments due to communication constraints, latency, energy consumption, and reliability requirements. From an artificial intelligence perspective, this paper proposes an enhanced multiagent reinforcement learning framework that employs action estimation neural networks to infer agent behaviors. By integrating a lightweight action estimation module, each agent infers neighboring agents'behaviors using only locally observable information, enabling collaborative policy learning without explicit action sharing. This approach is fully compatible with standard TD3 algorithms and scalable to larger multiagent systems. At the engineering application level, this framework has been implemented and validated in dual-arm robotic manipulation tasks: two robotic arms collaboratively lift objects. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances the robustness and deployment feasibility of real-world robotic systems while reducing dependence on information infrastructure.

Understanding the mechanisms through which artificial intelligence acceptance affects job crafting is critical for optimizing workforce adaptation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis longitudinal study employed a three-wave cross-lagged panel design. A total of 598 nurses from six tertiary hospitals in China completed surveys on artificial intelligence acceptance, decent work perception, and job crafting over a six-month period. Structural equation modeling and bootstrap analysis were used to test longitudinal mediation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nArtificial intelligence acceptance showed declining stability over time, while decent work perception increased, and job crafting stabilized. Cross-lagged analyses revealed that artificial intelligence acceptance positively predicted job crafting both directly and indirectly via enhanced decent work perception. The mediating effect accounted for over one-quarter of the total effect.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nThese findings challenge static views of technology adoption, suggesting that artificial intelligence implementation triggers dynamic psychological and behavioral responses among nurses.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nEarly acceptance of artificial intelligence technology significantly predicts subsequent job crafting, both directly and through the mediating role of decent work perception.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING\nEnhancing nurses' early acceptance of artificial intelligence and strengthening their perception of decent work may foster more proactive job crafting behaviors.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING POLICY\nNurse managers and policymakers should incorporate psychological support and dignity-enhancing strategies into artificial intelligence integration plans.

Here we show that large language models spontaneously develop synergistic cores -- components where information integration exceeds individual parts -- remarkably similar to those in the human brain. Using principles of information decomposition across multiple LLM model families and architectures, we find that areas in middle layers exhibit synergistic processing while early and late layers rely on redundancy, mirroring the informational organisation in biological brains. This organisation emerges through learning and is absent in randomly initialised networks. Crucially, ablating synergistic components causes disproportionate behavioural changes and performance loss, aligning with theoretical predictions about the fragility of synergy. Moreover, fine-tuning synergistic regions through reinforcement learning yields significantly greater performance gains than training redundant components, yet supervised fine-tuning shows no such advantage.

This fact has contributed to the creation of systems that aim to adapt the learning process to each individual learner and offer them a personalised experience. The problem of letting automated systems manage the whole learning process is the lack of human factor, but learning objectives and teacher criteria are crucial. That is why this research proposes a solution that combines the potential of AI without neglecting the teacher decision. Concretely, the proposal is an AI model that selects the most suitable activity to each learner. To do so, this proposed model is structured in two phases. The first is the prediction phase, in which the model predicts the score a learner will obtain and the time they will spend to complete an activity. Then, in the second phase, the selection of a single activity is done by means of instructional strategies. These strategies are based on the previously obtained metrics and establish the criteria to follow for selecting activities. The selected strategy is always set by the teacher, who will guide the learners through the process. With this model, this research proposes a combination of AI techniques with human decision-making. Instead of relying the learning process to an automated engine, it includes the teacher as the one to guide the AI by making the last decision.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "1397303137", "name": "Alberto Real-Fernández", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2220836224", "name": "Javier García-Sigüenza", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "1397303114", "name": "F.

While legal aid has long been the sole recourse for bridging this gap, its overstretched capacity is insufficient to meet rising demand. This article examines the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in democratizing legal aid by analyzing its ethical, practical, and regulatory challenges. AI applications – including chatbots, predictive analytics, and automated legal documentation – are scrutinized through case studies of platforms such as DoNotPay, COMPAS, ROSS Intelligence, Luminance, and LawGeex to demonstrate how AI can improve the affordability, efficiency, and accessibility of legal services. Despite its promise, AI raises critical concerns regarding algorithmic bias and data privacy that threaten to undermine fairness and inclusivity. This research situates these issues within global regulatory frameworks, encompassing the EU AI Act, OECD AI Principles, GDPR, and HIPAA, underscoring the necessity for robust standards of accountability and transparency. The article concludes by proposing policy recommendations – such as regular audits, independent oversight, and equitable funding – to ensure ethical AI deployment. The study argues that AI can transform legal aid into a more affordable and democratic system, provided its use is cautiously regulated and complemented by human supervision.

Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly significant role in medicine and has the potential to assist not only specialists but also other medical professionals in detecting fractures based on X-ray and CT scans. Algorithms based on deep learning are particularly useful in radiology and orthopedics.\nPurpose of the study. Summary of publicly available publications and studies comparing the effectiveness of AI and physicians in recognizing bone fractures.\nMaterials and methodology. A review of the literature available on PubMed, Google Scholar and Scopus was conducted.\nConclusions. The use of artificial intelligence algorithms can reduce the time required for fracture detection to as little as one minute. AI is better at identifying fractures that are difficult for humans to detect but struggles with more obvious and visible fractures. Artificial intelligence has the same or lower sensitivity and specificity in fracture detection as a specialist doctor but achieves higher accuracy compared to a resident doctor or a general practitioner.\nSummary. Based on the analyzed studies, it can be observed that artificial intelligence  will prove useful as an aid; a suggestion in diagnosis for a young doctor, but does not replace specialist doctors, who achieve higher accuracy in detecting fractures on X-rays and CT scans. Furthermore, it is worth reconsidering the reanalysis of existing studies and comparing AI results not only with human knowledge but also with CT scans, as they are considered more reliable.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2392154693", "name": "Maria Kasprzak", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2392158420", "name": "Damian Osiński", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2392153385", "name": "Zuzanna Kawa", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2392153588", "name": "Aleksandra Jędrzejewska", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2392153340", "name": "Aleksandra Jureczko", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2183643174", "name": "Klaudia Kleczaj", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2392156700", "name": "Valentyna Levadna", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2392153108", "name": "Julia Jaworowska", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2392153095", "name": "Gabriela Babiarz", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2392155992", "name": "Julia Kanarszczuk", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

This method provides support for eliminating redundant attributes and enhancing the efficiency of decision tree optimization. Secondly, considering that the conventional decision tree information gain ratio fails to account for dependencies between decision attributes and conditional attributes, an approach that replaces information entropy with attribute importance gain ratio is established for selecting optimal test attributes. Additionally, a method for branching based on equivalence classes derived from test attributes is introduced. This novel approach provides methodological support for thoroughly capturing intrinsic associations among attributes and improving the precision and accuracy of knowledge acquisition using decision trees.

If this occurs, then the mathematical solution of equation of motion is changed drastically. This is the exact point covered by the present article and a suitable procedure (namely the key-point) for ML is given.

For instance, two similar policyholders might receive different underwriting outcomes due to gradual, unintended model shifts. Behavioral drift poses significant risks in regulated environments, including compliance violations, reputational damage, and erosion of customer trust.\nThis paper introduces the Behavioral Drift Testing Framework (BDTF), a domain-specific methodology designed to detect, analyze, and mitigate behavioral drift in life insurance AI models. BDTF integrates synthetic personas, historical replay, counterfactual testing, fairness benchmarks, drift signatures, threshold monitors, and retraining guardrails into a cohesive, lifecycle-driven approach.

This article critically examines how generative artificial intelligence, while often celebrated for accessibility and linguistic support, can foster learner dependency and undermine the development of sustained cognitive engagement. Drawing on extended classroom observations and reflective teaching practice within a United Arab Emirates higher education context, the study identifies recurring patterns of disengagement, superficial linguistic understanding, and a growing reluctance to grapple with language complexity. These behaviors are conceptualized through the notion of the Brat Brain, a metaphor used to describe a learner mindset that resists effort and critical thinking, demands instant solutions, and privileges convenience over intellectual growth. Rather than asking how to improve their writing or speaking, students increasingly question why such effort is necessary when artificial intelligence can produce faster and seemingly superior outputs. Reframing artificial intelligence use through the good, the bad, and the (educationally) evil, the article offers a critical lens for evaluating both the affordances and the unintended consequences of artificial fluency in language education.

Drawing parallels with biological evolution, where simple components are optimized and recombined to create sophisticated functional structures, these artificial intelligence frameworks employ analogous principles to develop autonomous problem-solving systems by predicting new connections and expanding established relationships. The emergence of higher-order capabilities from relatively simple artificial intelligence building blocks enables these systems to tackle challenging problems in protein modeling, molecular mechanics, and engineering design. Physics-aware agentic models go beyond conventional data-driven inference, through their ability to self-improve, error-correct, and learn from real-time feedback, autonomously planning experiments, generating and executing code, and reasoning over results - effectively closing the loop in scientific discovery. Their inherent capacity to seamlessly integrate data-driven and physicsdriven modeling approaches enables artificial intelligence systems to independently formulate hypotheses, design simulations, and analyze outcomes, representing a significant advance in automated scientific investigation. Unlike prior surveys, this perspective emphasizes the emergence of higher-order cognition and reflection in multiagent systems, framing them as autonomous collaborators rather than passive assistants. This perspective examines how this new paradigm is accelerating multidisciplinary breakthroughs in protein design, mechanics, and materials science, and explores its implications for the future of computational, theoretical and experimental research methodologies.

While global debates on artificial intelligence ethics usually center on secular or practical structures, the Greek Orthodox heritage brings a distinct moral dimension inspired by spiritual anthropology, the theology of the human person, and the notion of heavenly likeness. The study looks at Greek consumers' perceptions of artificial intelligence from ethical, moral, and religious angles depending on data gathered from the author's Ph.D. dissertation (omitted for blind review). It examines the degree to which religion influences public opinion, acceptance, and emotional engagement with smart systems. The research reveals that individuals occasionally evaluate artificial intelligence (AI) not only for its utility but also for its fit with their moral values, spiritual integrity, and freedom. By fusing Orthodox ethical principles with modern AI debate, this paper presents a novel conceptual framework: the Theological-Moral Framing Model of AI. This theory clarifies how group and individual reactions to new technologies are influenced by cultural identity, moral narratives, and religious beliefs. The paper argues that in Greece and other faith-based nations, developing culturally sensitive AI management and public relations strategies depends on an awareness of this religious aspect. \n  \nReceived: 25 November 2025 / Accepted: 30 December 2025 / Published: January 2026", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2404912133", "name": "Theofanis Aritzis", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

However, traditional AI platforms tend to be black-box, so interpretability is usually limited, and it allows biases to exist that compromise trust and undermine managerial control. To overcome these issues, the present paper introduces a proposal of an explainable artificial intelligence-based decision support system to improve fairness, reliability, and policy compliance in the workflow of social-benefit distribution. Its approach combines interpretable prediction modelling, equity-sensitive modifications, uncertainty estimation, and human-in-the-loop oversight and places it into one pipeline. Quantitative analysis of synthetic and real-world welfare data demonstrates that the proposed structure removes demographic bias by 22.7% and decision under perturbations by 18.4 and greater explanation fidelity by 31.2 than non-explainable bases do. The system further enhances the consistency of the allocation by 17.5% and reduces the risk of policy-violation by 14.9 %, and at the same time, it sustains the competitive predictive accuracy. As experimental findings indicate, there might be not only the higher quality of generated balance and credible recommendations of benefits but the enhanced managerial control due to the transparency of decision rationales and audit-traceable procedures. The results emphasize the usefulness of explainable and decision-aware AI systems in facilitating socially responsible and accountable decision making towards the administration of the public good.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2279599955", "name": "Shakun Garg", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2353561993", "name": "Amit Verma", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

This article presents a conceptual framework for auditable and source-verified AI-based clinical decision support, grounded in principles from evidence-based medicine, data provenance, and trustworthy AI. The proposed architecture integrates a curated medical knowledge base with explicit provenance metadata, a retrieval-augmented reasoning (RAG) engine that links generated recommendations to identifiable clinical guidelines and peer-reviewed sources, and a tamper-evident audit logging mechanism that records system inputs, retrieved evidence, and inference steps for retrospective review.

Key feasibility challenges are discussed, including knowledge-base governance and updating, citation fidelity in RAG architectures, bias propagation from underlying evidence, latency and usability trade-offs, privacy considerations, and alignment with emerging regulatory frameworks such as FDA Software as a Medical Device guidance and the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act.

Sampling-based traditional auditing has several challenges with identifying anomalies or new risks in financial information environments that are becoming increasingly complex and more data-rich. Methods In this study, AI-based techniques (machine learning and natural language processing) will be applied to a number of the steps involved in auditing financial information. The predictive model will be applied to lead propensity analysis and business volume forecasting, allowing the examination of both structured and unstructured data on financial statements and protecting the privacy of client data. Results A predictive model utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) was able to identify leads at an 87% rate of accuracy; forecasted business volume errors were less than 5%; and it explained nearly 94% of the variance between the AI model’s predictions and the actual loan disbursement amounts. Using AI for full dataset analysis instead of sample-based methods improved auditors’ ability to detect anomalies and allocate resources efficiently. Discussion Overall, the research demonstrates that AI provides auditors the capability to evaluate all data for a company, automate routine tasks, and identify specific areas (high-risk/high-value) that may require further review compared to other auditing methods. The new methodology also allows for early identification of potential risks and improves the overall efficiency of audits without compromising the protection of the companies’ data.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "118830044", "name": "Amar Johri", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2377005621", "name": "Anu Sayal", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2335946150", "name": "Kim Mee Chong", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2320039749", "name": "Maysoon Khoja", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2215954607", "name": "Chaithra N", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2215913005", "name": "Janhvi Jha", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2406569569", "name": "Neha Tyagi", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": ["Medicine"]}

This study aimed to explore how data mining techniques can enhance robotic decision-making, enabling robots to learn, adapt, and respond to dynamic environments. A qualitative-analytical research design was used to examine the impact of intelligent data processing on robotic behavior, particularly in social robots. The analysis revealed that real-time data mining significantly improves robot autonomy, adaptability, and human interaction. Moreover, the integration of data mining introduced critical security challenges, such as distributed denial of service (DoS) attacks, sensor data eavesdropping, and manipulation of input data. The study found that implementing advanced security mechanisms—including encryption, authentication, and anomaly detection through artificial intelligence algorithms—helps mitigate these risks effectively. The findings emphasize the transition from task-executing machines to intelligent systems capable of independent decision-making. One notable application discussed in the paper is the development of social robots that interact naturally and empathetically with humans. This research highlights the importance of embedding data mining within robotic architectures not only to enhance performance but also to strengthen security and resilience.

One of the significant approaches to enable the individual to control privacy is the privacy policy document, which contains vital information on this matter. Publishing a privacy policy is required by regulation in most Western countries. However, the privacy policy document is a natural free text-based object, usually phrased in a legal language, and rapidly changes, making it consequently relatively hard to understand and almost always neglected by humans. Methods This research proposes a novel methodology to receive an unstructured privacy policy text and automatically structure it into predefined parameters. The methodology is based on a two-layer artificial intelligence (AI) process. Results In an empirical study that included 49 actual privacy policies from different websites, we demonstrated an average F1-score > 0.8 where five of six parameters achieved a very high classification accuracy. Discussion This methodology can serve both humans and AI agents by addressing issues such as cognitive burden, non-standard formalizations, cognitive laziness, and the dynamics of the document across a timeline, which deters the use of the privacy policy as a resource.

This study conducted a systematic literature review to examine both traditional and emerging fraud patterns and evaluate fraud detection methods with emphasis on artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. A comprehensive structured search across Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar yielded 28 peer-reviewed studies published between 2015 and 2025 that met eligibility and quality criteria. The findings reveal that traditional fraud patterns such as member collusion, embezzlement, and asset misappropriation coexist with emerging digital fraud such as mobile payment fraud, phishing, card fraud, and cryptocurrency scams. While rule-based and audit-based detection remain ineffective, machine learning has demonstrated significant promise for real-time detection but faces challenges related to class imbalance, interpretability, and data privacy. The review identified a weak Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure, the absence of SACCO-specific fraud detection models, and hybrid frameworks.

To address this challenge, ensuring model reliability requires a focus on three major aspects: credibility, adaptability, and interpretability. To achieve these objectives in a unified way, a new reliable learning pattern which consists of training, adaptation, testing, and second decision stage was proposed to extend the traditional training-testing pattern. Based on this framework, a new evidential reasoning rule learning (ER2L) strategy was developed, where individual-reliability is defined to tune the trained model for fitting the test sample better in adaptation stage and overall-reliability is introduced to measure the credibility of the model outputs for the second decision. Furthermore, due to ER2's nature as a probabilistic inference engine, the model is interpretable. Building on ER2L, a new ML approach termed Naïve ER2 (NER2) was proposed.

This lack of transparency and clinical alignment poses major challenges for regulatory compliance and professional trust. This study proposes a novel hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) meta-model for CDSS design, which formally translates established engineering decision support paradigms into the clinical domain to create systems that are inherently safer and more explainable. The framework rigorously integrates: (i) Web Ontology Language 2 for formalizing medical concepts; (ii) a semantic web rule language rule base to serve as “clinical guardrails” for enforcing evidence-based guidelines and safety constraints; and (iii) a modular inference policy that intelligently matches decision problems with specific data-driven or probabilistic methods. A prototype was implemented, combining this explicit knowledge layer with modular inference engines and template-based explanations. Evaluation across two large-scale clinical tasks (oncology using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database and intensive care using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database) demonstrated superior performance over data-driven baselines. Specifically, the hybrid system achieved a 78% reduction in guideline-violation errors (reducing the contraindication rate from 18% to 6%) while maintaining high predictive accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.84 and 0.87, respectively). Furthermore, a clinician usability study confirmed that the transparent, knowledge-driven explanations resulted in significantly higher decision clarity (Likert rating of 6.2/7) and reduced cognitive load. The findings validate that this hybrid AI architecture represents a robust and transferable approach to designing clinically aligned, trustworthy, and explainable CDSS, directly addressing critical requirements for the responsible deployment of AI in healthcare.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2354899507", "name": "N.

In this paper, we introduce the clustered partial explanation (CPE) framework, a novel three‐level methodology comprising global, partial, and local analyses, designed to bridge this gap. The proposed framework combines cluster‐based subgrouping with explainable artificial intelligence techniques to uncover latent variations in feature influence and model behavior. We apply the proposed framework to a breast cancer survival prediction task using a Random Forest model trained on the SEER dataset. The resulting partial explanations reveal heterogeneous feature importance patterns across clusters, highlighting interactions that remain obscured under global analysis.

By enabling real-time interaction between physical and cyber-physical systems, Industry 5.0 fosters personalized, adaptive, and sustainable production environments. However, the growing diversity of industrial products and user requirements presents challenges in effectively matching industrial users with suitable design solutions or manufacturing resources. Recommendation systems, particularly those based on Collaborative Filtering (CF), have emerged as powerful tools to address this issue by leveraging user preferences and behavioral data. Nevertheless, traditional CF algorithms often encounter efficiency bottlenecks when processing the high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and dynamic data typical of Industry 5.0 environments.To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a clustering-based CF algorithm that improves recommendation efficiency by incorporating industrial user relationship modeling. Furthermore, a Density-Sensitive Distance Transformer (DSD-Transformer) framework is developed to enhance clustering precision and recommendation accuracy.

A scientometric review of 441 publications (2009–2025) guided the systematic assembly of a dataset comprising 363 SFGPC mixes. Five ML models were trained to predict compressive strength (fc), with Gradient Boosting (GB) achieving the highest accuracy, yielding R2 = 0.954, RMSE = 3.15 MPa, MAE = 1.81 MPa during training, and R2 = 0.95, RMSE = 3.128 MPa, MAE = 2.41 MPa during testing. Multi-layered XAI analysis identified age, slag content, and alkaline-to-binder ratio as the most influential parameters and revealed governing nonlinear interactions. Sustainability assessment showed that the fly ash-dominant mix exhibited the lowest global warming potential (156 kg CO2-eq/m3), the most favourable sustainability index, and the smallest residual emissions after a 25% carbon offset.

Currently, organizations combat the spread of conspiracies through manual fact-checking processes and the dissemination of counter-narratives. However, the effects of harnessing the same automation to create useful bots are not well explored. To address this, we create BotSim, an Agent-Based Model of a society in which useful bots are introduced into a small world network. These useful bots are: Info-Correction Bots, which correct bad information into good, and Good Bots, which put out good messaging. The simulated agents interact through generating, consuming and propagating information. Our results show that, left unchecked, Bad Bots can create a conspiratorial society, and this can be mitigated by either Info-Correction Bots or Good Bots; however, Good Bots are more efficient and sustainable than Info-Correction Bots . Proactive good messaging is more resource-effective than reactive information correction. With our observations, we expand the concept of bots as a malicious social media agent towards automated social media agent that can be used for both good and bad purposes.

However, existing segmentation models suffer from inaccurate segmentation, slow processing, and large model size that limit their deployment on resource-constrained devices. To this end, we propose a lightweight model called Efficient Memory Aggregation U-shaped Network (EMAUnet) for human segmentation in video, which is based on a traditional U-shaped network and attention mechanism. In EMAUnet, memory modules are combined with segmentation modules, enabling end-to-end learning of semantic extraction patterns for human images. Mobile-inverse bottleneck convolution (MBConv) is used as the network backbone that has relatively few parameters and computational complexity. Inverted sub-pixel down-sampling (ISP) is proposed to minimize information loss and achieve detail-preserving of segmentation. Coordinate attention (CA) is adopted to precisely locate the portrait area. Moreover, bidirectional memory update (BMU) and memory update trigger (MUT) are proposed to improve memory resource utilization and reduce unnecessary computation. Experimental results show that, compared with the classic model ISNet, EMAUnet has the mIoU, FPS and pixel accuracy increased by 2.3%, 25.0% and 1.8%, respectively, while the amount of parameters and the size of model decreased by 33.3% and 45.7%, respectively.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2356048149", "name": "Xiaoyao Zhang", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2277694734", "name": "Lan Yao", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2054265310", "name": "Feng Zeng", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science"]}

Such AI-based tools could be integrated and potentially offer advantages over currently used diagnostic and monitoring algorithms, enabling the pursue of more individualized treatment options with potentially improved patient outcomes in the future. However, very few studies exploring the potential of AI-based tools have been reported in veterinary medicine. Diagnosis and subclassification of chronic inflammatory enteropathy (CIE) and protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), requiring an integrated approach including several diagnostic modalities, remains a challenge in clinical canine gastroenterology and might benefit from AI-based tools. Thus, we aimed to use AI-based deep learning to develop a model that can differentiate clinical cases of protein-losing PLE from non-PLE CIE using ultrasonographic (B-mode) images. This pilot study included anonymized data extracted from the electronic medical records and diagnostic images from routine diagnostic evaluations of 59 dogs. Following several optimization steps, the final model had a high accuracy (91.57%), precision (0.9286), recall (0.9070), F1 score (0.9176), and AUC-ROC (0.9529). This model was highly sensitive and specific for the detection of ultrasonographic features associated with clinicopathologic and/or histological lesions consistent with a PLE diagnosis. Combining sonographic diagnostics with machine learning yielded a high degree of accuracy in PLE differentiation. The results of this study underscore the potential of integrating an AI-based model into CIE diagnostics and PLE differentiation in clinical canine gastroenterology.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2403770423", "name": "Anne-Kathrin Reichert", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2404426783", "name": "Kariem Ali", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2403735119", "name": "Amna Asif", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2310051346", "name": "Romy M.

Limited research has explored the development of distributed generative models, particularly in scenarios where training data originate from various heterogeneous sources. To fill the gap, this article introduces a distributed generative model framework aimed at enhancing data generation in hierarchical IoT systems. The proposed framework supports distributed data generation across three distinct scenarios: feature-related data, label-related data, and feature-label nonrelated data. Furthermore, both synchronous and asynchronous update mechanisms are incorporated to accommodate diverse application requirements within IoT environments. Comprehensive experiments using simulated, image, and tabular datasets are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed framework in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.

Furthermore, deep learning-based object detectors that achieve state-of-the-art results are computationally expensive and considered as black-box solutions. Developing countries, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, face a shortage of radiologists and orthopedists. For this reason, this paper proposes a methodological approach that uses a more efficient object detection model to diagnose long bone fractures and provide prescription recommendations. An enhanced anchoring process, known as adaptive anchoring, is proposed to improve the performance of the Regional Proposal Network and the object detection model. A Faster R-CNN model with ResNet-50/101 and ResNext-50/101 backbones was used to develop an object detection model that uses X-ray images as input. To understand and interpret the model’s decision, a Gradient-based Class Activation Mapping method was used to assess the model’s learnability. The results indicate that the proposed adaptive anchoring approach can improve computational efficiency, reducing training time by up to 29% compared to the traditional approach. Model accuracy during training and validation ranged between 94% and 98%. Overall, adaptive anchoring performed better when applied with the ResNet-101 backbone, yielding an Average Precision of 92.73%, an F1 score of 96.01%, a precision of 96.80%, and a recall of 95.23%. The study provides valuable insights into the use of computationally efficient deep learning models for medical recommendation systems. Future studies should develop models to diagnose fractures using input images from various modalities and to provide prescription recommendations.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2237275244", "name": "Daudi Mashauri Migayo", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2213156", "name": "S.

However, training accurate models on real-field data remains challenging due to over fitting and limited generalization. As observed in prior studies, traditional CNNs often struggle with real-environment variability, and transfer learning can lead to instability in training on domain-specific leaf datasets. This study focuses on detecting dome galls, a disease in Cordia dichotoma, by formulating a binary classification task (healthy vs. diseased leaves) using a custom dataset of 3,900 leaf images collected from real field environments. Methods Initially, both custom CNNs and transfer learning models were trained and compared. Among them, a modified ResNet-50 architecture showed promising results but suffered from over fitting and unstable convergence. To address this, the final sigmoid activation layer was replaced with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), and L2 regularization was applied to reduce over fitting. This hybrid DeepSVM architecture stabilized training and improved model robustness. Image preprocessing and augmentation techniques were applied to increase variability and prevent over fitting. Results The final model was evaluated on a separate test set of 400 images, and the results remained stable across repeated runs. DeepSVM achieved an accuracy of 94.50% and an F1-score of 94.47%, outperforming other well-known models like VGG-16, InceptionResNetv2, and MobileNet-V2. Conclusion These results indicate that the proposed DeepSVM approach offers better generalization and training stability than conventional CNN classifiers, potentially aiding in automated disease monitoring for precision agriculture.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2339637827", "name": "Said Khalid Shah", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "40793322", "name": "M.

The main goal is to explore how AI methods can improve resource allocation, power control, interference management, traffic prediction, and mobility management in diverse and changing wireless environments. The study seeks to provide a clear understanding of how different AI approaches work and how they fit into developing network structures. The methodology includes a thorough review and analysis of AI techniques like supervised and unsupervised machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithms, and hybrid models. This research examines these methods based on their principles, strengths, and real-world applications for optimizing wireless networks. It combines findings from various case studies and experimental results to show AI's role in improving network adaptability and efficiency. Key findings show that AI-driven optimization significantly surpasses traditional heuristic and static methods because it enables real-time, data-driven decision-making. This leads to better network throughput, lower latency, improved energy efficiency, and more effective interference management. AI techniques, especially reinforcement learning and deep learning, support adaptive resource management, predictive traffic handling, and smooth mobility in ultra-dense and multi-tier networks. The impact of this research shows how AI can transform wireless networks into intelligent, scalable, and sustainable systems that can support new applications like autonomous systems, smart cities, and immersive multimedia.

This research offers a conceptual framework, AI Constructivist Learning Model (AICLM), based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Constructivist Learning Theory (CLT). Motivation, engagement, and societal expectations, based on CLT, are identified as external variables in TAM. These three constructs support active, autonomous, and student-centered learning. A systematic search of academic databases was conducted following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Sixteen empirical studies published from 2021 to 2025, indexed in Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, were included in this review. Articles were selected on the basis of certain keywords such as, AI, English writing, TAM, and CLT. Findings indicate that students perceive the ease of use and usefulness of AI if they have high motivation, more engagement, and positive societal expectations. Therefore, motivation, engagement, and societal expectations are significant external variables that influence the attitudes of students toward AI acceptance in improving English writing. AI integration in English writing development can be successful if the interaction between the constructs of TAM and CLT is understood well. CLT supports why and how students engage actively with AI tools. Students are more likely to accept AI if it increases motivation enhances engagement and fulfils societal expectations.

However, beneath the glorious appearance of the rapid development of AI technology, increasingly serious environmental problems are gradually emerging. To train and operate AI systems, power demand from data centers has skyrocketed, having tripled in just five years and being expected to triple again by 2030 [1]. This staggering increase starkly contrasts with less than 3% of annual global electricity production growth witnessed over the past 40 years, far outpaced by AI's ballooning energy needs [2], as shown in Figure 1 left. If we continue down this path relying on traditional processors, the growth of large language models (LLMs) may soon reach an unsustainable ceiling. This urgency is amplified by the reality that early efficiency gains in AI hardware are plateauing. Data centers nowadays principally utilize GPUs for both training and inferences. While GPU manufacturers often highlight improvements in efficiency—claiming a 40,000x improvement over the past decade—these numbers obscure several underlying concerns [3]. Upon scrutinizing the sources of the improvement, it becomes evident that sustaining such a pace of progress will be fraught with challenges.

These gains are attractive, but in a regulated environment speed is never enough. Regulators want assurance that every system is reliable, that decisions are explainable, and that human accountability remains central. This paper sets out a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) AI approach for Computer System Validation (CSV) and Computer Software Assurance (CSA). It relies on explainable AI (XAI) tools but keeps structured human review in place, so automation can be used without creating gaps in trust or accountability. Within this framework, AI provides draft recommendations such as mapping user requirements, highlighting redundant tests, or classifying deviations while subject matter experts (SMEs) review, adjust, and approve the final outcomes. Features like rationale cards, confidence bands, and traceable recommendations give SMEs the information they need to understand and, when necessary, challenge AI outputs. The framework is also supported by governance measures. These include model risk tiering to match oversight with potential impact, periodic model challenges to detect drift, and “evidence packs” that bring together AI outputs, human decisions, and audit trails into an inspection-ready format. Taken together, these safeguards show inspectors that automation is being used responsibly, not recklessly. We validate the approach in a two-project pilot, reporting mean cycle-time reductions of 32% (95% CI: 25%–38%) and higher inter-rater agreement (κ from 0.71 → 0.85), achieved under a defined governance model that includes model-risk tiering, quarterly challenge testing for high-risk models, and inspection-ready evidence packs aligned to 21 CFR Part 11 and Annex 11. These results provide preliminary empirical support so that HITL AI can improve efficiency and reviewer consistency while preserving accountability and regulatory trust. Practical case examples demonstrate that HITL AI can shorten validation cycles by 25%–40% while also improving reviewer consistency and strengthening inspector confidence. Rather than replacing SMEs, the system frees them from repetitive work so they can focus on risk and quality the areas where their judgment adds the most value. By blending automation with accountability, HITL AI provides a path for digital transformation that regulators are more likely to accept, positioning it as both a productivity tool and a model for sustainable compliance in the years ahead.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2407390453", "name": "Manaliben Amin", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

In this work, we propose a Hierarchical Brain-Inspired Reinforcement Learning (HBRL) architecture that combines the benefits of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with a biologically inspired cognitive hierarchy. The proposed architecture functions by simulating cortical–subcortical processing of information in which a high-level Policy-Gradient manager conducts abstract and long-term planning, and the low-level Deep Q-Network (DQN) agents complete real-time short-term actions. The proposed architecture’s multilayer structure includes temporal abstraction, modular learning, and the ability to refine policies to optimize experience, which makes it appropriate for dynamic and uncertain environments. We applied HBRL in three common scenarios: GridWorld, autonomous vehicle navigation, and smart-city infrastructure control to evaluate the proposed system design. Overall, we found that HBRL had a 15%–20% higher rate of completing tasks, 1.4–2.4 times faster learning efficiency, along with 70–100 points higher cumulative reward when high-level and low-level HBRL agents were compared to baseline approaches (e.g., DQN, Proximal Policy Optimization, and Soft Actor-Critic). A statistical analysis using two-tailed t-tests also assessed the significance of improvements (p < 0.01) among all tested environments. The hierarchical decomposition of tasks serves both to promote convergence and improve agents’ generalization capacity in unseen conditions. In its entirety, the proposed HBRL framework provides a scalable and cognitive-inspired learning paradigm for developing intelligent autonomous systems that exhibit human-likeadaptability and efficient decision-making capabilities in complex, nonstationary real-world environments.\n \nReceived: 14 May 2025 | Revised: 16 October 2025 | Accepted: 19 December 2025\n \nConflicts of Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest to this work.\n \nData Availability Statement\nData sharing is not applicable to this article as no new data were created or analyzed in this study.\n \nAuthor Contribution Statement\nKanthavel Radhakrishnan: Conceptualization, Methodology, Formal analysis, Resources, Data curation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review & editing, Visualization.

Artificial intelligence, defined as the field of computational systems that perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence, such as prediction, pattern recognition, and decision-making, is revolutionizing precision medicine through enhanced diagnostic accuracy, optimized treatments, and improved health outcomes. However, the benefits of artificial intelligence can only be realized if clinicians understand the technology’s limitations and strengths, and if developers appreciate the clinical, systemic, and workflow contexts in which their tools were developed and will be introduced. Without this mutual understanding, risks include automation bias, exacerbations of existing healthcare inequities, breaches of patient privacy, and ethical dilemmas that may erode trust in healthcare systems. \n \nTo address these challenges, the Temerty Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research and Education in Medicine at the University of Toronto has developed an interdisciplinary educational team and mandate. The mandate is organized into three guiding domains—principles, topics, and methods—that together provide a structured yet adaptable approach to artificial intelligence education. This commentary presents the rationale for this mandate and discusses its implications for precision medicine. Central to the mandate are commitments to formal, integrated training across disciplines, an emphasis on the ability to critically appraise artificial intelligence tools, and the delivery of interactive, evolving educational programs that are tailored to professional roles. As artificial intelligence continues to shape the landscape of healthcare, interdisciplinary and adaptive education will be critical to ensuring ethical artificial intelligence deployment and use, continued patient-centered care, and personalized medicine.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2368252093", "name": "Julie Midroni", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2303725051", "name": "Gemma Postill", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2339997870", "name": "Abhishek Moturu", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2403907646", "name": "Nihal Haque", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2403907579", "name": "Laura Rosella", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

Artificial intelligence is increasingly replacing human decision-making in many aspects of life, and the legal domain is no exception. Consequently, it is essential to explore how these technologies can contribute to the development and drafting of laws, as well as the challenges they may pose to existing legal frameworks.\nWhile this progress raises complex legal challenges that require careful analysis, artificial intelligence also offers promising opportunities to enhance the quality and effectiveness of legislation. This study therefore seeks to analyze the role of artificial intelligence in the legislative process, with a focus on the opportunities and challenges it presents in this context. The first section examines the role of artificial intelligence in the legal field in general, while the second section is devoted specifically to its role in improving the quality of legislation. In this regard, the study explores how artificial intelligence can be used to analyze vast amounts of legal data, thereby enhancing legislators’ ability to make more informed and accurate decisions. It also examines how artificial intelligence can simplify legal processes, increase productivity, and contribute to the drafting of legislation that is flexible and capable of adapting to rapid societal changes. Furthermore, the study addresses the ethical and legal implications arising from the use of these technologies, with a view to ensuring a balance between innovation and the preservation of fundamental legal values and principles", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "148775829", "name": "مصطفى الفوركي", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

Memasuki 2024, pemanfaatan AI tidak hanya terbatas pada ranah kreatif, tetapi juga meluas ke bidang komunikasi publik dan politik, sehingga memicu perdebatan baru mengenai dampaknya terhadap profesi art illustrator. Di satu sisi, sebagian seniman menilai AI dapat berfungsi sebagai alat bantu untuk mempercepat proses produksi, memperkaya eksplorasi gaya visual, dan meningkatkan efisiensi kerja. Di sisi lain, muncul kekhawatiran bahwa penggunaan AI berpotensi mengancam orisinalitas karya, menurunkan nilai ekonomi ilustrator, serta menimbulkan persoalan etis dan hukum, terutama terkait hak cipta dan penggunaan karya tanpa izin dalam pelatihan model AI. Perdebatan ini juga terlihat dalam konteks internasional, misalnya kritik dan penolakan sejumlah pihak terhadap praktik pelatihan AI yang memanfaatkan karya-karya studio animasi ternama tanpa persetujuan, termasuk isu yang dikaitkan dengan Studio Ghibli. Berangkat dari kondisi tersebut, penelitian ini bertujuan untuk (1) mengetahui sentimen publik terhadap dampak teknologi AI pada karir art illustrator melalui media sosial X, serta (2) mengevaluasi performa algoritma Support Vector Machine (SVM) dalam mengklasifikasikan sentimen.

Yet, high-quality training data remains a bottleneck in the development of many AI solutions, particularly for image segmentation. Therefore, ARAMSAM (agricultural rapid annotation module based on segment anything models) was developed, a user interface that orchestrates the pre-labelling capabilities of both the segment anything models (SAM 1, SAM 2) and conventional annotation tools. One in silico experiment on zero-shot performance of SAM 1 and SAM 2 on three unseen agricultural datasets and another experiment on hyperparameter optimization of the automatic mask generators (AMG) were conducted. In a user experiment, 14 agricultural experts applied ARAMSAM to quantify the reduction of annotation times. SAM 2 benefited greatly from hyperparameter optimization of its AMG. Based on ground-truth masks matched with predicted masks, the F2-score of SAM 2 improved from 0.05 to 0.74, while that of SAM 1 was improved from 0.87 to 0.93. The user interaction time could be reduced to 2.1 s/mask on single images (SAM 1) and to 1.6 s/mask on image sequences (SAM 2) compared to polygon drawing (9.7 s/mask). This study demonstrates the potential of segment anything models as incorporated into ARAMSAM to significantly accelerate the process of segmentation mask annotation in agriculture and other fields.

Yet the rapid expansion of AI into\nhighly regulated industries, critical infrastructures, public services and enterprise decision-making demonstrates that\nthe real strategic challenge for leadership is not simply to make models perform well, but to ensure their interpretability,\nauditability and responsible adoption across full business life cycles. Modern organisations increasingly rely on AI\nsystems that operate within complex sociotechnical environments, in which humans, institutions and legal frameworks\ninteract with automated processes in real time. In such contexts, AI models that remain opaque or non-explainable can\ncreate systemic risk, reputational vulnerability, operational bias and governance failures that extend far beyond the\npurely technological layer.\nThis article proposes that Explainable AI is becoming an essential managerial capability that reshapes organisational\nstrategy, trust architectures, human–machine collaboration models and digital transformation trajectories. The concept\nof explainability is not merely associated with feature attribution or model transparency; it establishes a foundation\nfor operational accountability, human-in-the-loop oversight and enterprise resilience, especially where decisions\naffect safety, fairness, equity or public trust. Consistent with European regulatory directions, including the EU AI\nAct and OECD Responsible AI principles, explainability is emerging as a core pillar of cognitive enterprise design,\nenabling organisations to transition from data-driven automation toward human-centred decision-making. Against\nthis background, the article develops an approach to Explainable AI that goes beyond technical implementation,\ndescribing a strategic rationale that enables business decision-makers to evaluate risk, define governance and unlock\nvalue creation. It outlines the early components of a managerial framework for assessing explainability trade-offs,\nidentifying business benefits and navigating regulatory expectations.

Manual radiological assessment, although clinically effective, is time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability, creating a need for reliable automated diagnostic systems. Most existing artificial intelligence (AI) studies focus on binary hemorrhage detection or limited subtype classification, leaving a gap in robust multi-class intracranial hemorrhage categorization. This study presents a validated deep learning pipeline based on the Swin Transformer—a hierarchical Vision Transformer architecture that employs windowed and shifted multi-head self-attention to capture both local and global contextual information. A balanced dataset of 60,000 CT images across six clinically relevant classes was generated through structured augmentation of a publicly available source, ensuring fairness and improved generalization. The model was optimized using AdamW, cosine annealing scheduling, and label smoothing to enhance stability. The proposed framework achieved a classification accuracy of 82.02%, outperforming the strong baseline EfficientNetV2-S model (80.17%). Statistical significance was established using McNemar’s test (p < 0.0001), and robustness was demonstrated through 5-fold cross-validation. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)++- based interpretability analysis further confirmed that the model consistently highlighted clinically meaningful hemorrhagic regions, reinforcing its diagnostic relevance. These findings establish the Swin Transformer as an effective, interpretable, and statistically validated solution for multi-class intracranial hemorrhage classification, with strong potential to support radiologists in emergency triage and improve clinical decision-making.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2342358447", "name": "Arun Singh", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "50984247", "name": "Manik Rakhra", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2409263336", "name": "Raunak Raj", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2322780420", "name": "Saiprasad Potharaju", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2359313361", "name": "M.

This technology can enhance perceived usability and immersion, creating a more realistic online shopping experience. However, consumers still combine physical and digital experiences to ensure the best purchasing decisions. Consumers visit physical stores and purchase products online, a process known as showrooming. This phenomenon is an evolving challenge for both retail and academics. This research examines the influence of channel characteristics (antecedents) and situational characteristics (consumers’ time pressure) as a moderating variable on showrooming behavior phenomena and avoidance of regret as consequences. This research surveys a representative sample of 474 Indonesian cosmetics and skincare shoppers. This study uses SmartPLS 4.0 to analyze the data. The results prove that channel characteristics (sales-staff assistance), online channel convenience, and social influence positively affect showrooming intentions. Then, showrooming behavior helps consumers reduce uncertainty, positively impacting avoidance of regret as consequences. By integrating the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Stimulus–Organism–Behavior–Consequence (SOBC) framework, this research model provides a comprehensive understanding of how external factors influence consumers’ psychological processes, which then shape their intentions and behaviors. Ultimately, showrooming behavior results in post-purchase consequences. This model integration is expected to analyze showrooming behavior in a more holistic modern retail context.

Traditional solutions have largely failed to address these issues simultaneously, often relying on fragmented manual processes or static chatbots that lack real-time capabilities. This paper presents a unified Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform designed to address these distinct problems using a novel ”Hybrid AI” architecture. A ”Two-Brain” system is proposed that integrates Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for static, knowledge-intensive customer queries and Tool-Using Large Language Model (LLM) Agents for dynamic, real-time logistical support. By leveraging open source technologies, specifically Django for the backend framework and PostgreSQL with pgvector for high-dimensional vector storage, and implementing semantic caching, a cost-effective, maintainable solution is demonstrated for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in developing economies. The design mitigates hallucination risks through strict context faithfulness protocols and ensures data sovereignty via a self-hosted infrastructure. Performance metrics regarding average latency, token cost efficiency, and data freshness are analyzed, showing that the dual-pathway approach significantly optimizes resource usage compared to traditional methods. Specifically, the semantic caching mechanism reduces API costs by approximately 60 percent for repetitive queries, while the real-time agent ensures critical safety data is retrieved with a freshness of under 10 seconds.

Recent developments in deep learning, especially transformer-based models for tabular data, have demonstrated superior capabilities in capturing nonlinear and high-dimensional biomarker interactions. This study proposes a predictive framework that uses statistical and clinical biomarker data to assess CVD risk. Traditional machine learning models (logistic regression, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, linear discriminant analysis, AdaBoost, and XGBoost) were compared with deep learning models (gated recurrent unit [GRU] and long short-term memory [LSTM]) and transformer-based models—self-attention and intersample attention transformer (SAINT), feature tokenizer (FT), and tab transformer. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of data augmentation, analyze learning behavior through loss and accuracy curves, and assess a fusion approach combining tab transformer with recurrent networks. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy and receiver operating characteristic analysis. Transformer-based models consistently outperformed conventional machine learning and deep learning methods. SAINT and FT achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8875 and 0.9489, respectively. The tab transformer demonstrated the highest performance with an AUC of 0.9728. The fusion of the tab transformer with GRU and LSTM further enhanced predictive precision, improving representation learning and generalization for CVD risk prediction.

This research investigates how students’ perceived agency of AI, usefulness, ease of use, trust, autonomy supporting, and self-efficacy collectively impact students’ self-learning behavior and motivation. Based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), and Self-Determination Theory (SDT) theories, our research model predicts an integrated model of motivational and behavioral processes underlying AI adoption in learning settings. Methods We adopted and followed a quantitative research design with a structured questionnaire administered among 280 higher education students in Saudi Arabia. We applied Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using SmartPLS 4 to analyze data. Results Findings indicate that students’ perceived agency of AI significantly predicts usefulness, ease of use, and autonomy supporting, while ease of use significantly enhances AI-enabled self-efficacy. Self-efficacy and autonomy supporting significantly impact self-learning motivation, driving self-learning behavior positively. But usefulness and trust in AI failed to influence self-efficacy directly, which reveals cultural and contextual settings. Discussion This research adds richness to the fusion of TAM, SCT, and SDT theories in illustrating how AI’s perceived autonomy and usability collectively promote self-directed learning motivation. This research also provides guidelines to educators and system designers to design AI tools that promote learner autonomous settings, usability, and confidence.

By combining large-scale, heterogeneous datasets, including electronic health records, genomic profiles, wearable device outputs, environmental measures, and social determinants of health, AI systems can identify complex relationships, reveal hidden risk factors, and forecast health outcomes with unprecedented accuracy. These capabilities enhance early detection of epidemics, support individualized care planning, and inform policies aimed at reducing health disparities. Machine learning and deep learning techniques allow healthcare systems to manage resources more efficiently, predict service demand, and optimize allocation during both routine operations and public health emergencies. Applications extend to chronic disease prevention and management, precision public health initiatives, and policy simulations that model the potential impact of interventions such as vaccination strategies, environmental regulations, or taxation policies. Despite their promise, the integration of AI and big data into population health research presents significant challenges. These include safeguarding data privacy, ensuring cybersecurity, mitigating algorithmic bias, overcoming interoperability barriers, and addressing ethical concerns related to transparency and accountability. Effective use of these technologies requires interdisciplinary collaboration among data scientists, healthcare professionals, policymakers, and ethicists. This paper critically examines the roles, benefits, and limitations of AI and big data in advancing population health research. It highlights case studies demonstrating improved health outcomes and operational efficiencies, while also outlining frameworks for ethical governance and equitable implementation. By addressing current challenges, AI and big data hold the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, promote health equity, and enhance population-level well-being on a global scale.\n ", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2407581879", "name": "Nnaemeka Daniel Chukwuemelie", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2319726444", "name": "Mubaraq Yussuf", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2312931199", "name": "Sulaimon Olajuwon Abdul", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

Conducted within the I-Tools To Design And Enhance Access To Justice (IDEA) project, it draws on a comparative survey across six Member States—Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Italy, and Lithuania—to identify best practices in digitalized court systems. The findings point to uneven digital maturity: Estonia and Lithuania lead in digital development (8.4/10; 8.0/10) and show more favorable attitudes toward predictive justice (6.0/10; 5.8/10); whereas Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, and Italy, despite having digital tools, struggle to integrate them into routine legal workflows, reinforcing greater resistance to predictive justice. Although digital justice can improve access and efficiency, concerns persist around fairness, judicial trust, and ethical safeguards. Progress, the study suggests, depends on participatory governance, clear regulation, and the careful integration of technology into procedural frameworks. Building on these insights, the current phase of IDEA positions AI as a regulatory instrument that structures access to justice and guides user behavior. The consortium is developing a legal chatbot to guide workers and employers toward the most suitable resolution pathway—negotiation, mediation, or litigation—based on context, cost, and procedural guarantees. The chatbot tailors its responses in accordance with prevailing legal trends and the reasoning behind case law. A pilot in three Member States (MSs) will test its potential to enhance transparency, empower users, and promote proportional, informed dispute resolution within European labor justice. Against this backdrop, the chapter conceptualizes AI—operating through structured information, triage, and explainability—as a regulatory instrument that can steer behavior ex ante and support compliance ex post in redundancy disputes, complementing adjudication without displacing judicial authority.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2407931341", "name": "Marianna Molinari", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2407929351", "name": "Marco Giacalone", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

Traditional surveillance systems often lack the spatial and temporal resolution needed to support proactive interventions. While socioeconomic indicators, such as the social vulnerability index and housing value, show moderate correlations with opioid-related outcomes, existing methods rarely incorporate high-resolution environmental data. Previous research relies largely on static census data and coarse geographic indicators, limiting its ability to detect localized risk patterns. Moreover, the connection between built-environment features and opioid overdose remains underexplored—especially in rural areas like Alabama’s Black Belt. To address this gap, we propose a multiscale spatio-temporal framework that integrates satellite imagery and machine learning to monitor opioid-related emergency room (ER) visit rates. We collected 201,967 housing images from Black Belt counties and classified them using computer vision models, including ResNet and external attention transformers. To overcome limitations in labeled data, we developed four unsupervised pipelines combining k-means clustering with autoencoders, masked autoencoders, VGG16, and household-image ratios. Our results show that unsupervised embeddings outperform supervised classification in capturing signals associated with ER visits. Descriptive features, such as roof type, road layout, and environmental openness, significantly inform predictions. Although Black Belt counties report lower absolute ER visit rates, they show faster year-over-year growth.

The present paper addresses the introduction of DropShipment business models against the backdrop of the associated process automation. Process automation plays a critical role in ensuring fast and efficient process execution at high order volumes. Consequently, the introduction of dropshipping also places extensive demands on the automation of business processes. While full process automation is technically feasible, it is subject to practical limitations. To this end, the dropshipping business model is analyzed in this paper with a focus on the technical implementation of automated business processes. The areas of action necessary for the implementation of automated dropshipping processes are analyzed. The analysis is based on a survey that examines the overall importance of the business model, the contribution of key action areas to developing integration solutions supporting automated processes, and future IT requirements. In the course of the survey, 19 to 21 dual Bachelor students in Computer Science and Business Informatics were asked for their assessments. The majority of respondents have no prior knowledge of DropShipping, so the survey results primarily reflect their spontaneous assessments after receiving an introduction to the topic. The study concludes that the DropShipping business model will gain increasing importance in the future. Furthermore, it became evident that requirements analysis, in particular, represents a significant effort while offering high value in developing integration solutions for automated process handling. The data analysis shows that the cost-benefit potential of using artificial intelligence methods to enable automated processes is optimal. Finally, it was found that creating automated DropShipping processes requires, to a particularly high degree, the expertise of software developers.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2405968958", "name": "David Kuhlen", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}

Most existing approaches are domain-specific and struggle to generalize across diverse plant organs or varying image qualities. To address this challenge, we propose a novel domain-independent classification framework that integrates quality-metric features—Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)—with an adapted lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is the first approach that explores quality measures as features for addressing challenges of classification of fruits and leaves infected by virus, fungus, and bacteria. The method first performs connected-component analysis on K-means clusters generated from R, G, B, and Gray channels to isolate disease-relevant regions and extract quality-based features. These features are fused with visual features extracted from the RGB images using a multimodal CNN architecture. Extensive experiments conducted on the proposed fruit–leaf dataset and four external benchmark datasets demonstrate that the model achieves high accuracy, strong robustness to blur, noise, rotation, and scaling, and superior generalization performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. Cross-domain evaluations further confirm that the proposed method is domain-independent and reliable for the classification of fruits and leaves infected by bacteria, fungi, and viruses.\n \nReceived: 24 September 2025 | Revised: 2 December 2025 | Accepted: 25 December 2025\n \nConflicts of Interest\nPalaiahnakote Shivakumara is the Editor-in-Chief for Artificial Intelligence and Applications, and he is not involved in the editorial review or the decision to publish this article.

This paper provides a structured, evidence-based synthesis of UAV applications in smart cities and their associated security challenges as reported in the literature over the last decade, with particular emphasis on developments from 2019 to 2025. We categorize these challenges into two primary classes: 1) cyber-attacks targeting the communication infrastructure of UAVs and 2) unwanted or unauthorized physical intrusions by UAVs themselves. We examine the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in developing intrusion detection mechanisms to mitigate these security threats. We analyze how AI-based methods, such as machine/deep learning for anomaly detection and computer vision for object recognition, can play a pivotal role in enhancing UAV security through unified detection systems that address both cyber and physical threats. Furthermore, we consolidate publicly available UAV datasets across network traffic and vision modalities suitable for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) development and evaluation.

However, large-scale mapping of these settlements is severely constrained not only by the scarcity of annotations but by inherent data quality challenges, specifically high spectral ambiguity between formal and informal structures and significant annotation noise. We address this by introducing a benchmark dataset for Lahore, constructed from scratch, along with companion datasets for Karachi and Mumbai, which were derived from verified administrative boundaries, totaling 1,869 $\\text{km}^2$ of area. To evaluate the global robustness of our framework, we extend our experiments to five additional established benchmarks, encompassing eight cities across three continents, and provide comprehensive data quality assessments of all datasets. We also propose a new semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to mitigate the class imbalance and feature degradation inherent in standard semi-supervised learning pipelines. Our method integrates a Class-Aware Adaptive Thresholding mechanism that dynamically adjusts confidence thresholds to prevent minority class suppression and a Prototype Bank System that enforces semantic consistency by anchoring predictions to historically learned high-fidelity feature representations. Extensive experiments across a total of eight cities spanning three continents demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised baselines. Most notably, our method demonstrates superior domain transfer capability whereby a model trained on only 10% of source labels reaches a 0.461 mIoU on unseen geographies and outperforms the zero-shot generalization of fully supervised models.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2408648583", "name": "Muhammad Taha Mukhtar", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2190335589", "name": "Syed Mohsin Ali Kazmi", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2348036981", "name": "Khola Naseem", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "9689475", "name": "M.

In the RSwinV2 method, a hierarchical structure of the transformer has been customized based on the input dimensionality, embedding structure, and output targeted by the method. In this RSwinV2 approach, the input image has been split into non-overlapping patches and processed using shifted windows and attention in these patches. This process has helped the method link all the windows efficiently by avoiding the locality issues of non-overlapping regions in attention, while being computationally efficient. RSwinV2 has further developed based on SwinTransformer and has included patch and position embeddings to take advantage of the transformer global-linking capability by employing multi-head attention in these embeddings. Furthermore, RSwinV2 has developed and incorporated the Inverse Residual Block (IRB) into this method, which utilizes convolutional skip connections with these inclusive designs to address the vanishing gradient issues during processing. RSwinV2 inclusion of IRB has therefore facilitated this method to link global patterns as well as local patterns; hence, its integrity has helped improve lesion classification capability by minimizing variability of Mpox and increasing differences of Mpox, chickenpox, measles, and cowpox. In testing SwinV2, its accuracy of 96.51 and an F1score of 96.13 have been achieved on the Kaggle public dataset, which has outperformed standard CNN models and SwinTransformers; the RSwinV2 vector has thus proved its validity as a computer-assisted tool for Mpox lesion observation interpretation.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2267339416", "name": "Rashid Iqbal", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2397487912", "name": "Saddam Hussain Khan Artificial Intelligence Lab", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2264923335", "name": "Department of Chemical Engineering", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2267334448", "name": "University of Engineering", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "88668084", "name": "A.

To address this, we propose an LLM-based MambaFormer hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for efficient medical question-answering (QA) and clinical assistance. The MambaFormer employs a lightweight gating mechanism that performs token-level dynamic routing to a customized Transformer expert (ET5) for short, complex queries or to a State Space Model expert (EMamba) for long, high-throughput sequences. The customized EMamba and ET5 models are tailored to accommodate input sequence dimensionality, embedding structure, sequence length, and target-specific output heads, and are fine-tuned through transfer learning on a new, custom-designed DentalQA dataset. Moreover, intelligent routing decisions are driven by the contextual complexity of token embeddings, normalized sequence length, and domain-aware features, thereby enforcing a Pareto-optimal trade-off between inference latency and prediction accuracy. Furthermore, a novel utility-guided multi-objective loss jointly optimizes decisions, router parameters, routing behavior, expert utilization, and computational cost by adaptively regulating token-level expert activation. Finally, the proposed MambaFormer is cross-validated (holdout) for medical QA on the new, custom-designed DentalQA and PubMedQA datasets and compared with state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed MambaFormer outperforms (BERTScore = 0.9180) with ultra-low latency (0.077 s), delivering a 24.4 speedup over T5-Large and establishing a scalable solution for resource-constrained clinical deployment.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2403932964", "name": "Hamad Khan", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2397487912", "name": "Saddam Hussain Khan Artificial Intelligence Lab", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2264923335", "name": "Department of Chemical Engineering", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "2267334448", "name": "University of Engineering", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "88668084", "name": "A.

This paper proposes a unifying framework in which cognition is understood as an organizational property of living systems, grounded in information embodied in their physical structures and in their ongoing interactions with the environment. Within this info-computational (ICON) perspective, living systems engage in behavior, learning, and anticipation by dynamically transforming embodied information through distributed, physically realized processes that support viability and self-maintenance. These processes are present from the onset of life and become progressively more integrated and temporally extended with increasing biological organization. The framework provides explanatory continuity across biological scales and clarifies how complex forms of cognition, awareness, and mind arise as elaborations of basic life-regulatory dynamics. It generates empirically grounded, testable implications for basal cognition, developmental biology, and embodied artificial systems, in the domains such as morphogenetic regulation, bioelectric control, and embodied physical architectures where its implications can be tested.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "1403731773", "name": "G.

A significant constraint in the development of effective treatments is the blood-brain barrier (BBB), as it greatly limits the access of therapeutic drugs targeting amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation and neuroinflammation. Nanobodies, single-domain antibody fragments derived from camelids, have emerged as versatile tools with unique properties such as small size, high stability and the ability to penetrate the BBB. Engineered formats allow for specific targeting of Aβ and tau, receptor-mediated transcytosis, and conjugation with therapeutic or diagnostic substances. Preclinical studies show that nanobody-based strategies can reduce pathological burden, attenuate neuroinflammation and improve cognitive outcomes in AD models. Manufacturing scale-up, long-term safety and regulatory validation are among the remaining challenges, yet nanobody engineering represents a viable path to disease-modifying medicines. Innovative approaches, including artificial intelligence-driven design, i.e. 4-1BB agonist nanobodies, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-facilitated diversification of nanobody libraries - such as targeted complementarity-determining region 3 mutagenesis followed by functional screening against disease-relevant tau or Aβ conformers - alongside half-life extension strategies, are commencing to surmount these obstacles and enhance the potential of nanobody platforms to develop into clinically viable disease-modifying therapies.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2406016072", "name": "Thee Jootar", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}, {"id": "1786349", "name": "S.

It aimed to synthesize evidence on orthographic anomalies, error patterns, and variation in English to Arabic and Arabic to English transliteration across social media, shop names, and linguistic landscapes. The fourteen studies share a unified methodological framework and provide quantitative data (percentages, frequencies, and error rates) that allow for statistical aggregation. The fourteen studies were categorized into 3 clusters: Shop names and linguistic landscapes, personal names, borrowed nouns, and ai generated transliteration. Results of the SR/MA revealed consistent patterns of inaccuracy and variation across human Arabic–English transliteration. In public signage, recurrent issues include vowel omission, inconsistent representation of consonants with no direct English equivalents, semantic and syntactic anomalies in compound names, and wide divergence from standard spellings. Personal names show similarly unstable patterns, with multiple transliterations for the same name, inconsistent rendering of the glottal stop and pharyngeal fricatives, variable spelling of the definite article /al /, and frequent gemination errors. Borrowed English nouns display phonological adaptation patterns shaped by Arabic orthography, especially in the representation of /g/ and other non native phonemes by Artificial Intelligence. Meta analytic pooling across studies shows high overall error rates, cross context variation, and tendencies toward under representation of vowels and over regularization of consonants. Subgroup analyses indicate that transliteration accuracy varies by domain, with signage showing the highest error density and personal names the greatest internal variability. Together, the findings demonstrate that human transliteration is shaped by sociolinguistic preference, orthographic habit, and contextual constraints rather than by standardized rules, establishing a coherent empirical profile of real world Arabic–English transliteration behavior. These results offer the first coherent map of human transliteration behavior and lay the groundwork for future research.", "language": null, "type": "paper"}, "authors": [{"id": "2314612917", "name": "Reima Al-Jarf", "orcid": null, "affiliations": []}], "fields_of_study": null}
