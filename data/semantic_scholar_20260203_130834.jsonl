Similarity-based retrievers provide coverage but remain shallow, whereas traversal-based methods rely on selecting seed nodes to start exploration, which can fail when queries span multiple entities and relations. We introduce ARK: Adaptive Retriever of Knowledge, an agentic KG retriever that gives a language model control over this breadth-depth tradeoff using a two-operation toolset: global lexical search over node descriptors and one-hop neighborhood exploration that composes into multi-hop traversal. ARK alternates between breadth-oriented discovery and depth-oriented expansion without depending on a fragile seed selection, a pre-set hop depth, or requiring retrieval training. ARK adapts tool use to queries, using global search for language-heavy queries and neighborhood exploration for relation-heavy queries. On STaRK, ARK reaches 59.1% average Hit@1 and 67.4 average MRR, improving average Hit@1 by up to 31.4% and average MRR by up to 28.0% over retrieval-based and agentic training-free methods. Finally, we distill ARK's tool-use trajectories from a large teacher into an 8B model via label-free imitation, improving Hit@1 by +7.0, +26.6, and +13.5 absolute points over the base 8B model on AMAZON, MAG, and PRIME datasets, respectively, while retaining up to 98.5% of the teacher's Hit@1 rate."}, "authors": [{"id": "2398901674", "name": "Joaqu'in Polonuer"}, {"id": "2382921451", "name": "Lucas Vittor"}, {"id": "2309173635", "name": "Inaki Arango"}, {"id": "2309175499", "name": "Ayush Noori"}, {"id": "2384122039", "name": "David A.

While many studies examine AI in consumer marketing, less attention addresses AI's role in creating and selecting trademarks that are distinctive, recognizable, and meaningful to consumers. Traditional economic approaches to trademarks focus almost exclusively on consumer-based, demand-side considerations regarding search. However, these approaches are incomplete because they fail to account for substantial costs faced not just by consumers, but by trademark applicants as well. Given AI's rapidly increasing role in trademark search and similarity analysis, lawyers and scholars should understand its dramatic implications. This paper proposes that AI should interest anyone studying trademarks and their role in economic decision-making. We examine how machine learning techniques will transform the application and interpretation of foundational trademark doctrines, producing significant implications for the trademark ecosystem. We run empirical experiments regarding trademark search to assess the efficacy of various trademark search engines, many of which employ machine learning methods. Through comparative analysis, we evaluate how these AI-powered tools function in practice. In an age where artificial intelligence increasingly governs trademark selection, the classic division between consumers and trademark owners deserves an updated, supply-side framework.

Fluorescein-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) enables real-time, cellular-resolution imaging of brain tissue during tumor resection. It is particularly valuable for evaluating nonenhancing brain tumors. However, CLE interpretation remains subjective. Although CLE has high sensitivity, it is less specific than standard histology. Existing artificial intelligence (AI) models process CLE images as independent frames, neglecting the temporal context that human experts use during interpretation. Methods A novel sequence-based deep learning model was developed to classify tumor grade on the basis of CLE image sequences, mimicking the visual reasoning process of expert neuropathologists. CLE images were collected from 16 patients with nonenhancing brain tumors. Each sequence was labeled as high grade or low grade based on neuropathologist interpretation, blinded to final histopathology findings. Visual features were extracted using pretrained backbones (vision transformer, VGG16, ResNet50), followed by temporal modeling with a transformer encoder and temporal convolution. This model was compared with conventional frame-based classification across 3 random train-test splits. Results The dataset included 105 CLE sequences (3,173 images, 40 regions of interest). The sequence-based model achieved top-1 classification accuracies of 93% (vision transformer), 88% (VGG16), 74% (ResNet50), and 67% (Inception-ResNet-V2), outperforming corresponding frame-based models (78%, 74%, 55%, and 50%, respectively). Diagnostic performance was comparable to expert neuropathologist interpretation (87%). The model demonstrated robustness in artifact-affected sequences and improved interpretability by incorporating temporal progression. Conclusions AI models that integrate both visual and temporal information from CLE digital imaging sequences can effectively classify brain tumor grade with accuracy comparable to that of expert neuropathologists, outperforming frame-based models. Such a system reduces interpretive subjectivity and holds promise as an intraoperative decision CLE support tool for nonenhancing brain tumor resection."}, "authors": [{"id": "2142450403", "name": "Jiuxu Chen"}, {"id": "2145139687", "name": "Yuan Xu"}, {"id": "39938412", "name": "I.

The objective of the study was to assess the relative impact of the cybersecurity challenges, legal infrastructures, and e-governance maturity on the cyber threats and trust of clientele. The study utilized a quantitative research design, gathering data through a survey distributed to employees and managers within a number of financial institutions. With a data sample of 400 employees, the survey data were analyzed through a variety of methods, such as descriptive statistics, reliability, Pearson correlations, and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The study established that the risks posed by inadequate cybersecurity infrastructures substantially increase the threats. Also, the risks posed by inadequate legal regulations and low e-governance maturity do not appear to increase the challenges. Legal adequacy positively impacts trust. Exposure to cyber threats with unmitigated risks and poor legal regulations and low e-governance maturity do not appear to increase the challenges. The study relies on the trust of cyber clientele to validate and uphold the proposed theoretical framework suggesting the need for an integrated approach consisting of high-quality legal regulations, comprehensive governance, and secure advanced cybersecurity to ensure the safe merging of AI and IoT. In addition, the study sheds light on the perspectives of policymakers, regulators, and financial institutions aiming to build safe and reliable digital financial systems in the UAE and Jordan."}, "authors": [{"id": "115625319", "name": "F.

Top military commanders typically play an important role in these deliberations around whether to use force. These commanders are relied upon for their expertise. They provide information and guidance about the military options available and the potential outcomes of those actions. This article asks two questions: (1) how do military commanders make these judgements? and (2) how might AI be used to assist them in their critical decision-making processes? To address the first, I draw on existing literature from psychology, philosophy, and military organizations themselves.

The aim of this scientific study is to examine the interdisciplinary use of artificial intelligence, data management and sustainability at the European Union level, including support instruments such as regulatory initiatives and funding programs, and to assess their implementation in relation to smart cities. Methodologically, the research is based on a legal analysis of key European and national documents, supplemented by descriptive statistics and visualizations of indicators of digitalization and urban sustainability.

AI methods may enable the dynamic recognition of complex time-frequency EEG patterns and the adaptation of monitoring strategies to patient-specific brain responses. Convolutional neural networks, artificial neural networks, and hybrid deep learning models have reported encouraging results in detecting anesthetic states, estimating bispectral index values, and identifying relevant EEG features - such as alpha-delta shifts or burst suppression - without relying on manual feature engineering. Parallel efforts using virtual and augmented reality platforms suggest possible benefits for anesthesiologist training in EEG interpretation and pharmacologic titration.\n Despite these advances, important limitations constrain clinical translation. A major challenge is the absence of standardized EEG pattern definitions across anesthetic agents and patient groups, limiting model generalizability. Restricted interoperability between EEG monitors and electronic health records, coupled with proprietary data formats, reduces access to raw EEG signals and hampers large-scale development. Privacy and governance requirements add further barriers to data integration. Methodologically, many studies are affected by insufficient internal validation, suboptimal reporting, and testing in experimental rather than real-world conditions, reducing their translational value. While AI could eventually improve anesthetic precision and safety through EEG-guided approaches, realizing this potential will require transparent algorithms, multicenter and heterogeneous datasets, and robust interoperability and data-sharing standards.

This meta-analysis synthesizes empirical evidence on the effectiveness of AI-based interventions in enhancing the learning outcomes of preservice teachers across cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains. A systematic review of 5,880 studies led to the inclusion of 19 effect sizes from 11 rigorously selected studies spanning diverse geographic and disciplinary contexts. Using Hedges’ g and a random-effects model to account for high heterogeneity, the analysis reveals a large overall effect size, affirming AI’s substantial positive impact on teacher preparation. Moderator analyses highlight the influence of contextual factors such as country, learning outcome, and intervention duration. Studies from Palestine, Ethiopia, and the UAE, revealed strong effects which suggest the importance of local readiness and institutional support. Cognitive outcomes showed the most consistent gains, while affective and psychomotor results were more variable. Most interventions operated at the Augmentation level of the SAMR model, a framework that categorizes levels of technology integration in education, indicating that transformative uses of AI in teacher education remain limited. This study offers critical insights for policymakers, educators, and global teacher education programs aiming to integrate AI effectively. It underscores the need for context-sensitive, ethically responsible, and pedagogically innovative AI applications that go beyond enhancement toward true educational transformation.

AI uses computers to help surgeons make better decisions, plan surgeries, and even guide them during operations. For example, AI can help spot lung cancer earlier by analyzing scans and test results more quickly and accurately than before. During surgery, smart robots and computer programs can help surgeons be more precise, making the surgery safer and helping patients recover faster. After surgery, AI can help physicians watch for problems and predict which patients might need extra care, using information from wearable devices and medical records. While these new tools are promising, there are still challenges. AI needs to be tested widely to make sure it works for everyone, and physicians must be careful about privacy and fairness. Some computer programs can make mistakes or be hard to understand, so experts are working to make AI safer and easier to use. Overall, AI is helping medical doctors to improve care for people who need chest surgery, but more research and careful planning are needed before these tools become a regular part of medical practice."}, "authors": [{"id": "2283055628", "name": "Francesco Petrella"}, {"id": "2237916925", "name": "S.

AI companies are now planning data center sites with up to 5 GW capacity, and the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that data center demand could grow to 1,700 TWh by 2035 (6% of current total global electricity demand). Power grid connections are becoming a major bottleneck, and it can now take more than five years to receive a grid connection for a new data center in the United States and Europe. The challenge of getting grid connections has driven a new trend toward grid defection, where data centers are being fully or partially supplied by local microgrids with dedicated generation assets. In some regions this is a voluntary choice, but in most cases, it is the only option available for building a new data center. For most data centers, it is likely that a substantial grid connection would be beneficial from both an economic and a sustainability perspective due to how main power grids unlock generation economies of scale and enable lower-cost renewable integration. However, inefficient AI data center grid defection is being driven by a reliance on preexisting technical approaches and institutional barriers to change. In this article, we propose “multiscale grid intelligence” as a new framework to fight AI data center grid defection and support closer coordination between data centers and power grids. The proposed framework embeds power-grid-focused analytics into how data centers are planned and operated, accounting for cooptimization opportunities across spatial scales (from data center rack-level distribution to national transmission) and time scales (from second-to-second frequency balancing to years-ahead network planning). Across these scales, we identify a range of opportunities for intelligent planning and operation that could offer significant value if implemented together. The article discusses the value multiscale grid intelligence can offer power system and AI stakeholders and proposes key areas for future research."}, "authors": [{"id": "2280638697", "name": "Thomas Morstyn"}, {"id": "2280456181", "name": "Yihong Zhou"}, {"id": "2407281072", "name": "Ian Whitfield"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Grounded by Rogers’ diffusion of innovation theory and Davis’s technology acceptance model, a mixed-mode survey design was used to assess educators’ awareness, perceived benefits, competencies, and barriers to AI adoption. Findings revealed a significant experiential divide across all measured themes, where early-career educators (with ≤5 years of experience) reported significantly higher awareness, perceived benefits, competence, and optimism about overcoming barriers than experienced educators (with ≥ 15 years of experience). The primary barrier to adoption was a shared and uniform high level of concern regarding the pedagogical and ethical implications of AI. This contrast suggests that the central challenge is a pedagogical adoption gap between educators’ operational skills and their deeper apprehension of reconciling AI with their professional identity. This study confirms prior research on technology adoption while identifying a novel ethical barrier associated with the use of generative AI in agricultural education. The findings support the recommendation of differentiated approaches to enhance the confidence of experienced educators and reinforce the ethical best practices for early-career educators."}, "authors": [{"id": "2238330290", "name": "James R.

We aimed to establish the level of acceptance of AI‐based digital mental health interventions (AI chatbot, AI avatar‐based interventions) compared with the acceptance levels of teletherapy via videoconferencing among clinicians, patients and a representative community sample (i.e., potential future patients). We also explored the extent to which these differences towards these technologies might be explained by individuals' attitudes towards AI in general. Clinicians (N = 658), patients (N = 451) and US census–based community sample (N = 520) completed standardised measures of everyday artificial intelligence use, general attitudes towards AI and acceptability of digital technology use for mental health interventions. We found that community participants are most optimistic about AI‐based mental health tools (chatbots and avatars), whereas clinicians consistently express more scepticism, especially regarding usability. In our sample, general attitudes towards AI (both positive and negative) were highly associated with acceptance of chatbot and avatar‐based interventions, more than their professional role or demographic identity.

This Perspective synthesizes recent literature to map how artificial intelligence (AI) supports forecasting and situational awareness, optimization, and real-time control of distributed assets, and community-oriented markets and engagement, while arguing that adoption is limited by system-level credibility rather than model accuracy alone. The analysis highlights interlocking deployment barriers, such as governance-integrated explainability, distributional equity, privacy and data governance, robustness under non-stationarity, and the computational footprint of AI. Building on this diagnosis, the paper proposes principles-as-constraints for sustainable, trustworthy LES AI and a deployment-oriented validation and reporting framework. It recommends evaluating LES AI with deployment-ready evidence, including stress testing under shift and rare events, calibrated uncertainty, constraint-violation and safe-fallback behavior, distributional impact metrics, audit-ready documentation, edge feasibility, and transparent energy/carbon accounting.

We present a comprehensive framework that deeply integrates heterogeneous environmental data and physical propagation knowledge into AI models for site-specific channel prediction, which referred to as channel inference. By leveraging AI to infer site-specific wireless channel states, the proposed paradigm enables accurate prediction of channel characteristics at both link and area levels, capturing spatio-temporal evolution of radio propagation. Some novel strategies to realize the paradigm are introduced and discussed, including AI-native and AI-hybrid inference approaches. This paper also investigates how to enhance model generalization through transfer learning and improve interpretability via explainable AI techniques. Our approach demonstrates significant practical efficacy, achieving an average path loss prediction root mean square error (RMSE) of $\\sim$ 4 dB and reducing training time by 60\\%-75\\%.

The JAK-STAT signaling axis plays a central role in colorectal tumor biology, yet its relevance under FOLFOX-based chemotherapy in EOCRC remains poorly defined. In this study, we evaluated 2515 colorectal cancer (CRC) cases (266 H/L; 2249 non-Hispanic White [NHW]), stratifying analyses by ancestry, age of onset, and FOLFOX exposure. Statistical comparisons were performed using Fisher’s exact and chi-square tests, and survival patterns were assessed via Kaplan–Meier analysis. To extend conventional analytics, we deployed AI-HOPE and AI-HOPE-JAK-STAT, conversational artificial intelligence platforms capable of harmonizing genomic, clinical, demographic, and treatment variables through natural language queries, to accelerate multi-parameter biomarker exploration. JAK-STAT pathway alterations showed marked variation by ancestry and treatment context. Among H/L EOCRC cases, alterations were significantly enriched in patients who did not receive FOLFOX compared with those who did (21.2% vs. 4.1%; p = 0.003). A similar pattern emerged in late-onset CRC (LOCRC) NHW patients, where alterations were more frequent without FOLFOX exposure (13.3% vs. 7.5%; p = 0.0002). Notably, JAK-STAT alterations were significantly more common in untreated H/L EOCRC compared with untreated NHW EOCRC (21.2% vs. 9.9%; p = 0.002). Survival analyses revealed that JAK-STAT pathway alterations conferred improved overall survival across several NHW strata, including EOCRC treated with FOLFOX (p = 0.0008), EOCRC not treated with FOLFOX (p = 0.07), and LOCRC not treated with FOLFOX (p = 0.01). These findings suggest that JAK-STAT alterations may function as ancestry- and treatment-dependent prognostic markers in EOCRC, particularly among disproportionately affected H/L patients. However, prognostic interpretation in H/L subgroups is limited by small mutation-positive sample sizes, reflecting historical underrepresentation and highlighting the need for larger ancestry-balanced studies. The integration of AI-enabled platforms streamlined analyses and reveals the potential of artificial intelligence to accelerate discovery and advance precision medicine for populations historically underrepresented in cancer genomics research."}, "authors": [{"id": "2333703205", "name": "F.

Traditional ML techniques only provide black-box QoE models, meaning that the models’ internal reasoning is hard to understand. This makes it difficult not only to gain valuable insights into the data and the underlying QoE influence factors, but also to build trust in the predictions of the QoE model. To address these challenges and enhance performance, we identify four critical aspects for any data-driven QoE model: explainability, context adaptability, quantification of uncertainty, and data decentralization. In this work, we focus on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which is a promising solution to obtain explainable models allowing to address all critical aspects for data-driven QoE modeling. This tutorial introduces and explains relevant concepts from XAI and related fields. We apply these techniques to two realistic use cases, video streaming QoE modeling and Web QoE modeling, for two different modeling tasks, classification and regression, and discuss their value in the context of XAI-based data-driven QoE modeling.

Eight surgeons (27%) and 4 implementation leaders (24%) were female. Most surgeons (17 [57%]) had neutral views of the technology, 11 (37%) expressed positive views, and 2 (7%) had negative views. Interviewees identified the following 4 major themes that highlighted misalignment between user expectations and the experience of using the technology: (1) the artificial intelligence model needed considerable additional training to be usable; (2) accessing data on surgical cases was difficult and time consuming; (3) the program showed limited ability to predict postoperative complications; and (4) the program generated few academic deliverables.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nPer the results of this multisite qualitative study, successfully implementing interventions based on artificial intelligence may require deliberate efforts to minimize gaps between what surgeons expect from the interventions and what they can deliver.

This chapter establishes the conceptual and methodological foundations of HCAI by tracing its evolution and recent advancements. It introduces key HCAI concepts, frameworks, guiding principles, methodologies, and practical strategies that bridge philosophical HCAI principles with operational implementation. Through an analytical review of the emerging characteristics and challenges of AI technologies, the chapter positions HCAI as a holistic paradigm for aligning AI innovation with human values, societal well-being, and sustainable progress.

This terminological uncertainty creates systemic legal risks, ranging from the uncritical acceptance of algorithmic results as absolutely reliable to the difficulties in challenging decisions made using AI. Thus, the development of doctrinal definitions is no longer a purely theoretical task and is becoming a vital practical requirement for the safe integration of AI technologies into criminal proceedings. The subject of this study is the analysis and structuring of existing approaches to defining artificial intelligence, as well as the delineation of key concepts such as \"artificial intelligence,\" \"AI system,\" and \"AI assistant/agent\" for the purposes of their subsequent effective legal regulation in criminal proceedings. This study utilizes terminological, comparative legal, and critical analysis of existing scientific and legislative definitions of AI. The scientific novelty of this study lies in its proposal of an original three-level hierarchy of concepts, specifically adapted to the needs of criminal proceedings. The author consistently distinguishes: 1) AI as a field of knowledge and technology; 2) an AI system as a specific software product – the primary object of legal regulation; 3) functional roles (AI assistant and autonomous AI agent), classified according to the degree of autonomy in performing procedural actions. The main conclusion is that legal regulation should shift from the abstract concept of \"artificial intelligence\" to specific AI systems, establishing a differentiated legal regime depending on their functional role and level of independence. The degree of autonomy of the system is proposed to be the key regulatory criterion. Consolidation of this system of definitions will create the necessary terminological foundation for a balanced legal regime that will realize the potential of AI to improve the efficiency of legal proceedings without violating fundamental procedural guarantees."}, "authors": [{"id": "2402092436", "name": "Aram Edvardovich Arzumanyan"}], "fields_of_study": null}

The relevance of this research is driven by ongoing digital transformation, in which the introduction of artificial intelligence systems into criminal proceedings affects fundamental rights and freedoms, changing traditional decision-making procedures. The significance of this work is determined by the need for the Russian Federation to understand the American experience, which represents a large-scale natural experiment in the integration of technologies within a decentralized legal system and the dominance of the private sector in the development of specialized artificial intelligence systems. The purpose of this study is to analyze law enforcement practice and the emerging regulatory ecosystem, as well as to formulate conclusions of theoretical and practical value for the development of the domestic legal system. The study utilizes a combination of general and specialized scientific methods, including the analysis of regulatory acts, case law, and scientific literature, comparative legal analysis, as well as a method for systematizing and classifying empirical data related to the implementation of artificial intelligence systems in the United States. The scientific novelty of this study lies in its systematic analysis of the American model for regulating the use of artificial intelligence in criminal proceedings as a uniquely \"reactive\" and decentralized system, shaped primarily by judicial precedents and state legislation. The article critically examines key issues: algorithmic and ideological bias; the explainability of decisions made by artificial intelligence systems; the opacity of algorithms; and the risk of \"blind delegation\" of decisions to the system. The main conclusions of the work boil down to the need for preemptive federal legal regulation in Russia, which should establish a classification of AI systems by risk level, mandatory audit requirements, procedural guarantees of the rights of the parties, and the allocation of liability. The author substantiates the priority development of domestic AI systems, the phased implementation of AI, beginning with a \"co-pilot\" model, where AI systems perform an auxiliary analytical function, as well as the need to develop a professional culture and specialized training for lawyers to critically analyze the results generated by artificial intelligence systems."}, "authors": [{"id": "2402092436", "name": "Aram Edvardovich Arzumanyan"}], "fields_of_study": null}

AI-driven applications, such as intelligent recommendation systems, virtual assistants, data-driven personalization, and predictive analytics, have better facilitated consumers' access to information, reduced uncertainty, and infused purchase-related evaluations. The case is particularly relevant in India, where EV adoption remains at its incipient stage despite increased environmental concerns and supportive policy initiatives. This paper examines the role of Artificial Intelligence in shaping consumer perception and behavioural response and, thereby, also investigates its influence on purchase intentions for electric vehicles amongst Indian consumers. A structured questionnaire survey was administered to 405 respondents residing in Coimbatore city, India, all of whom possessed valid driving licences. The sample included both current EV users and prospective adopters intending to purchase an EV soon. Descriptive statistics and inferential analytical techniques, including Independent Sample t-tests and Multiple Regression Analysis, were employed to assess the impact of AI-driven factors on consumer perception, perceived behavioural influence, and purchase intention. Findings uncovered a significant positive association between consumer perception, perceived behavioural influence, purchase intention, and electric vehicles using artificial intelligence. Additionally, this study revealed a significant positive impact of artificial intelligence factors on consumers’ purchase intentions, emphasizing the pivotal role of artificial intelligence in replaying a significant risk-reduction and decision-making confidence-enhancing effect in the adoption of electric vehicles.\n\n\n\n\nKey Words: Artificial Intelligence, Electric Vehicles, Purchase Intention, Consumer Perception, Consumer Behaviour"}, "authors": [{"id": "2407587918", "name": "Priya Kalyanasundaram"}, {"id": "2407588769", "name": "Thirumoorthi.

The emerging new paradigm called agentic AI involves agents that move beyond decision support tools to becoming semi-autonomous collaborators in research, clinical, and rehabilitation tasks.\n\n\nPURPOSE\nThe purpose of this review is to summarize how recent advances (April 2022 to October 2025) in automation, prediction, and augmentation agents are poised to transform the practice of orthopaedics; and to outline the conceptual, technical, and ethical foundations of this transition.\n\n\nRECENT FINDINGS\nAn agent is software that can process information and act independently to execute a set of defined tasks. It can seek knowledge, ask for help, deploy other software, and learn from its actions. Automation, prediction and augmentation agents can be leveraged in multi-agent and federated-learning architectures, working together to create coordinated ecosystems that can manage complex tasks and that improve with clinical use. Collectively, the output of such ecosystems is referred to as agentic AI. However, regulatory and ethical concerns underscore the need for transparency, equity, and the preservation of human agency within these frameworks.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nAgentic AI marks a transition from passive tools that merely assist clinicians to autonomous systems that act alongside them. The success of this technology in orthopaedics will depend on the depth of human-machine collaboration they enable and how well they align computational precision with the enduring human art of restoring motion and health."}, "authors": [{"id": "2402885571", "name": "Fabrizio Billi"}, {"id": "2251156631", "name": "Stefano A.

This article introduces the machine-integrated relational adaptation (MIRA) model, a transdisciplinary, middle-range theoretical framework that provides a foundational account of when, how, and why AI functions as a relational entity in human ecosystems. MIRA distinguishes two crucial roles of AI: relational partner (direct-interaction companion) and relational mediator (shaping human-to-human communication). Synthesizing psychosocial theories of human relationships, interpersonal communication theory, psycholinguistics, and human-computer interaction, MIRA structures AI's relational impact within antecedents, processes, moderators, and outcomes. Central to MIRA are four principles describing how AI fosters social adaptation: linguistic reciprocity, psychological proximity, interpersonal trust, and relational substitution versus enhancement. These principles illuminate how adaptive AI language and behavior can elicit emotional investment, simulate mutual understanding, or even supplant human interaction. MIRA integrates established theories-attachment theory, social exchange theory, and epistemic trust frameworks-and proposes a research agenda that bridges foundational psychology with emerging sociotechnical contexts. Rather than offering a deterministic view, MIRA provides a generative, testable structure for investigating the evolving role of AI in relational life and guiding future human-AI-connection research."}, "authors": [{"id": "2218265178", "name": "Ryan L.

This review aims to be an authoritative, critical, and accessible review and discussion of general interest to the drug repurposing community concerning the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools. Emerging questions include what is achievable with AI in this domain and what its impact will be, what AI and ML embrace, and how we, as geneticists, pharmacologists, and computational scientists, can contribute to the discovery of new, inexpensive, and affordable repurposable medicines. The fast growth of genetics and multiomics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and radiomics) and electronic health records in diverse populations contributes to answering questions, including how to rapidly identify effective repurposable medicines, what a clinically meaningful effect size in trials is, and what the potential implications for precision medicine are. This review discusses AI and ML for drug repurposing in the context of genetics, multiomics, real-world data collection, and crowdsourcing of knowledge.

Panel data on Chinese A-share listed tourism enterprises for the period 2013–2023 were used in the analysis. Grounded in corporate social responsibility theory and stakeholder theory, the empirical analysis indicates that the adoption of artificial intelligence is positively associated with improved ESG performance among tourism enterprises. Further analysis suggests that AI adoption positively affects ESG performance mainly through two channels: customer base diversification and improvements in corporate reputation. Moderating effect tests reveal that climate risk strengthens the promoting effect of AI on ESG performance, while media attention weakens this effect. The heterogeneity results indicate that the positive impact of AI adoption on ESG performance is stronger among firms facing less government environmental scrutiny and those operating outside the culture, sports, and entertainment sectors.

This review of the literature explores 542 current articles to analyze the new paradigm of Green Artificial Intelligence as a group to make AI innovation and environmental stewardship align through energy-saving algorithms, green computing methods, and climate-aware implementation models. Our methodological approach was based on the PRISMA system, as we searched databases and filtered 1,052 records and finally settled on 534 articles, which directly relate to the topic of AI and sustainability. In our analysis, it is possible to note a tremendous advancement of energy-saving machine learning algorithms, green data centers, the integration of renewable energy usage, and artificial intelligence usage to monitor the environment and take climate action. Nevertheless, there exist decisive loopholes in the standardized measurement systems, lifecycle assessment approaches, harmonization of policies and fair access of green AI innovations in developing economies. The contribution of this review is the observation of seven major areas of implementation, the assessment of the emergent methods of energy optimization, issues of implementation and a hierarchical research agenda. "}, "authors": [{"id": null, "name": "Dimple Ravindra Patil"}, {"id": "2094038990", "name": "N.

Traditional methods like motion capture, force plates, and wearable sensors, while great, are very expensive and require a specific environment in which to work. Because of this, they are not very accessible. These methods may take a long time to analyze. However, with the advent of newer methods of Artificial intelligence, we can automate feature detection, analyze in real time, and extract even more findings in more variables. \nMethods: For this study, a combination of different methodologies was used. For the qualitative analysis of the models, the author used data from the sensors, videos, and the clinical documentation of patients with neuromuscular and musculoskeletal disorders. The author used machine learning classifiers, convolutional neural networks, and long short-term memory networks to analyze and classify gait and predict rehabilitation potential in order to handle performance evaluation in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and robustness. \nResults: AI-based systems consistently outperformed traditional methods. Clinical applications demonstrated earlier detection of neurological disorders, wearable AI devices improved rehabilitation adherence, and computer vision models showed resilience under variable conditions such as lighting and clothing. In sports, AI provided real time biomechanical feedback to reduce injury risk and enhance performance. In security, AI-driven gait recognition strengthened biometric identification by adapting to environmental variability. \nConclusion: AI is not merely an incremental improvement but a paradigm shift in gait and movement analysis.

On the one hand, automated collection and analysis of big data creates new risks for information privacy and individual rights. On the other hand, artificial intelligence technologies themselves possess significant potential for enhancing data protection through predictive threat analysis, access control, and transparency. This paradox requires careful scientific understanding. The subject of this research is the legal, organizational, and technical mechanisms for ensuring data security when using artificial intelligence systems in criminal proceedings. The aim of the study is to demonstrate, through a comparative analysis of international experience (Germany and China), that appropriate legal regulation can transform the use of artificial intelligence systems from a source of threats into an effective tool for ensuring data security in criminal proceedings. The article employs a combination of general scientific and specialized methods. The basis for this research is a comparative legal analysis of criminal procedural regulation and AI application practices in Germany and China. The formal legal method was also used to analyze regulatory acts, and the system analysis method was used to study the architecture of AI systems as an element of procedural safeguards. The scientific novelty lies in the substantiation of the thesis that data security is ensured not by prohibiting or limiting the use of modern technologies, but by their procedural integration. Using the German model as an example, it is demonstrated that consistent legal regulation (the principle of targeted restriction, access gradation, and encryption requirements) creates the basis for the legitimate use of specialized artificial intelligence systems. The Chinese model of legal regulation also ensures data security, but not through strict prohibitions and restrictions, but through the centralized architecture of the AI system used in criminal proceedings. It is concluded that many risks associated with the use of AI systems are transitional in nature and can be overcome through legal regulation and technological development. Proposals have been formulated to improve current legislation: establishing the status of electronic data, “technologically neutral” encryption requirements, establishing criteria for admitting non-governmental developers, and obligations to ensure the interpretability of artificial intelligence solutions."}, "authors": [{"id": "2402092436", "name": "Aram Edvardovich Arzumanyan"}], "fields_of_study": null}

However, these innovations raise concerns about professional adaptation and job security.\nObjectives: To investigate Nigerian radiographers’ awareness, perceptions, and adaptability regarding these technologies, with a focus on job security and professional relevance.\nMethod: A cross-sectional survey of 349 Nigerian radiographers assessed awareness, perceptions, and adaptability regarding AI and theranostics. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics (SPSS v25).\nResults: Awareness was higher for AI than theranostics: 31.2% were moderately familiar and 28.7% very familiar with AI, whereas 34.4% were not familiar with theranostics. Most respondents (64.5%) had not attended training or seminars. Regarding job security, 41.8% agreed AI and theranostics could reduce the demand for manual radiography skills, and 30.7% agreed automation might cause role displacement. Nevertheless, adaptability was promising: 51.3% expressed interest in further education or certification, and 48.1% viewed adoption as an opportunity for career growth. Key adaptation factors included mentorship (50.7%), financial support (45.6%), and curriculum integration (41.5%).\nConclusion: Nigerian radiographers demonstrate moderate familiarity with AI but limited understanding of theranostics. While job security concerns persist, willingness to upskill is strong. Structured training, mentorship, and curriculum reform are essential to support professional adaptation and safeguard radiographers’ relevance in the era of AI and theranostics.\nContribution: This study highlights the need for radiography professional bodies and policymakers to prioritize structured training pathways, financial incentives, and cross-disciplinary collaborations to ensure radiographers remain central to technological transitions.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nIntroduction\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and theranostics are rapidly transforming healthcare, particularly within medical imaging and radiographic practice, some of which include workflow optimization, image acquisition, diagnostic interpretation, and treatment planning (1).\nRecent advances in deep learning and neural networks have accelerated the integration of AI into clinical imaging, offering greater efficiency, improved accuracy, and enhanced patient safety (2). In parallel, theranostics — an approach that combines diagnostic imaging with targeted therapy — has gained increasing importance in nuclear medicine and precision oncology (3). By enabling clinicians to both detect and treat specific pathologies, theranostics exemplifies the move toward personalized medicine.\nGlobally, radiographers’ perceptions of these innovations have been mixed. While many acknowledge AI’s capacity to reduce errors, optimize workflows, and advance radio-graphic practice, others express concerns about automation leading to job displacement (4, 5). A study in Zimbabwe found that radiographers anticipated reduced roles and altered professional practices with AI adoption (6).\nSimilarly, Saudi Arabian radiographers largely agreed that AI would play a significant role in imaging, but cited barriers such as cost, lack of expertise, and machine reliability (7). Badera et al. (8) reported generally favorable attitudes toward AI among radiographers and radiologists but highlighted mentorship gaps as a key obstacle to adoption. These findings illustrate the global tension between optimism about technological progress and apprehension about professional security.\nDespite these developments, the Nigerian context remains underexplored. Although AI and theranostics are increasingly discussed in international literature, limited research has examined how Nigerian radiographers perceive these technologies or how prepared they are to adapt. Considering Nigeria’s evolving healthcare infrastructure, absence of theranostics training in most radiography curricula, and limited access to mentorship and continuing education, this knowledge gap is particularly significant. Without understanding local awareness and readiness, the professional practice in Nigeria risks falling behind in adapting to global technological shifts.\nThis study therefore investigates Nigerian radiographers’ awareness, perceptions, and adaptability regarding AI and theranostics. Specifically, it examines their concerns about job security, willingness to upskill, and the structural and educational supports necessary for effective professional adaptation.\nMaterials and Methods\nThis study employed a prospective cross-sectional survey design, conducted between October 2024 and January 2025 across private and federal government hospitals in Nigeria. Ethical clearance was obtained from an institutions review board (NHREC/05/01/2008B-FWA00002458-1RB00002323). The study population consisted of licensed radiographers registered with the Radiographers Registration Board of Nigeria (RRBN). Only practicing radiographers who consented to participate were included, while other healthcare workers, academic radiographers, industrial radiographers, and radiographers unwilling to participate were excluded.\nA convenience sampling technique was used and data were collected using a structured, self-administered questionnaire designed in Google Forms. The instrument consisted of three sections: Section I covered demographic characteristics such as age, gender, years of practice, specialty, and geopolitical zone of practice; Section II assessed awareness and understanding of AI and theranostics; while Section III focused on perceptions of job security, willingness to adapt, and factors influencing adaptation.\nThe questionnaire was pretested on 15 radiographers at a university teaching hospital to assess internal consistency using Cronbach’s alpha, and this yielded a coefficient of 0.79, indicating acceptable reliability. Content validity was ensured through expert review by radiography lecturers and clinical practitioners. The questionnaire link was distributed via professional WhatsApp groups, LinkedIn, email lists, and direct contacts of practicing radiographers. Participation was voluntary, and informed consent was obtained prior to completing the survey.\nCompleted responses were exported from Google Forms into IBM SPSS version 25 for analysis. Descriptive statistics such as frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations were used to summarize demographic and awareness data, while inferential statistics, including cross-tabulations and mean comparisons, were applied to explore perceptions and adaptability patterns. Results were presented in tables for clarity. Anonymity was maintained by ensuring that no personal identifiers were collected, and data were stored securely for academic purposes only. \nResults\nDemographic Characteristics\nOf the 349 radiographers who participated in the study, majority were male (56.7%) and within the 25–34 years age group (46.1%). Most respondents had practiced for fewer than five years (61.6%), reflecting a predominantly early-career workforce. The South-East geopolitical zone contributed the highest proportion of respondents (39.5%), while diagnostic radiography was the most common specialty (79.7%) (Table 1).\nAwareness and Understanding of AI and Theranostics\nFrom Table 2, familiarity with AI was generally higher than with theranostics. About 31.2% reported being moderately familiar with AI and 28.7% very familiar, while only 7.4% were not familiar at all. In contrast, awareness of theranostics was low, with 34.4% reporting no familiarity and only 7.7% describing themselves as extremely familiar. Knowledge sufficiency was also limited, as 42.7% either disagreed or strongly disagreed that their current knowledge of AI and theranostics was adequate to meet future professional demands. Furthermore, 64.5% of respondents had never attended training or seminars on either technology.\nPerceptions of Job Security\nConcerns about job security were evident. More than two-fifths of respondents (41.8%) agreed that AI and theranostics could reduce the demand for manual radiography skills, while 30.7% agreed that automation might lead to role displacement. At the same time, 74.5% acknowledged that integration of these technologies would require radiographers to acquire new skills to remain relevant (Table 3).\nWillingness to Adapt\nDespite concerns, respondents expressed a strong willingness to adapt. Over half (51.3%) indicated interest in pursuing further education or certifications in AI and theranostics, while 48.1% agreed that adoption of these technologies represented an opportunity for personal growth. Although peer resistance was reported as a possible barrier, most respondents viewed adaptation positively (Table 4).\nFactors Influencing Adaptation\nIn Table 5, more than half (50.7%) agreed that access to structured mentorship programs would facilitate adaptation, and 45.6% emphasized the need for financial support or incentives from employers. A further 41.5% supported the inclusion of AI and theranostics training in undergraduate curricula, while 44.4% highlighted the importance of collaboration with other healthcare professionals. However, workplace infrastructure was identified as a barrier, as only 40.1% agreed that their facilities had sufficient technological support.\nDiscussion\nRadiographers in this study demonstrated higher familiarity with artificial intelligence (AI) than with theranostics, a pattern that reflects the relative availability of these technologies in Nigeria. While AI is beginning to attract interest in some private institutions, it has not yet been integrated into routine clinical practice or healthcare policy (9 – 12).\nBy contrast, theranostics remains entirely theoretical in developing countries, with no established faci"}, "authors": [{"id": "2364452185", "name": "Sobechukwu Onwuzu"}, {"id": "2408070699", "name": "Adanna Uche-Nwankwo"}, {"id": "2408077898", "name": "Chinemerem Ozoamalu"}, {"id": "2408079245", "name": "Chikaosolu Ozohili"}, {"id": "2408075937", "name": "Ezinne Peter-Adim"}, {"id": "2408080149", "name": "Prisca Solomon"}, {"id": "2408074546", "name": "Precious Sopuluchukwu"}, {"id": "2408074012", "name": "Ikechuwku Onwunta"}], "fields_of_study": null}

This article addresses this question with respect to an ancient idea in Christian thought reaching back to St. Paul and examined again and again throughout history, namely, human conscience. While sometimes criticized as a tyrannous force in the human psyche, a mere product of social forces of race and class, or a horrific form of self‐torture, many Christian and non‐ Christian thinkers continue to examine conscience as a clue to the meaning of being human. This essay continues that examination in the light of the question of human ends and whether AI signals the end of humanity as we know and experience it. Further, the essay is written from the perspective of a robust Christian Humanism dedicated to the integrity of human life while acknowledging that human beings are technological as well as biological, social, and religious beings."}, "authors": [{"id": "2407544335", "name": "William Schweiker"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Complexity in severity appraisal, high-dimensional data, and the need for longitudinal, individualized assessment make PDA a compelling candidate for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven approaches. This systematic review evaluates AI research in the context of PDA, identifying strengths, limitations, and future directions.\n \n \n \n Following PRISMA 2020, databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles from January 1, 2010, to May 31, 2025. Eleven studies met inclusion criteria. Data on design, population, sources, AI methods, performance, validation, limitations, and explainability were extracted. Risk of bias was assessed using the Prediction model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool and Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist; reporting quality using the Minimum Information about Clinical AI Modeling checklist. Heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis; therefore findings were synthesized narratively.\n \n \n \n \n Eleven studies addressed diagnosis/screening (\n n\n  = 5), treatment-response prediction (\n n\n  = 2), risk-factor identification (\n n\n  = 2), treatment-complication prediction (\n n\n  = 1), and subphenotype analysis (\n n\n  = 1). Ten were retrospective; nine single-center, one multi-center, and one used a national registry. Sample sizes were mostly <500 (range: 66–8,369). Definitions of PDA subgroups—symptomatic and hemodynamically significant PDA—varied significantly. Populations included preterm, neonatal and pediatric cohorts, often excluding other congenital heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, or early mortality. Input data ranged from multimodal parameters to high-dimensional unimodal sources. Ten studies used supervised learning; nine traditional machine learning; five deep learning. No study performed adequate external validation. Diagnostic models achieved AUCs of 0.74–0.93, however risk of bias was high, particularly in analysis, suggesting overfitting. Models addressing other aspects showed modest performance. None of the included studies exhibited low risk of bias. Most studies addressed explainability to some degree; only one addressed clinical utility; none evaluated fairness. Reproducibility was hindered by manual preprocessing and limited sharing of data, models, or code.\n \n \n \n \n Artificial intelligence shows feasibility for supporting PDA risk stratification, diagnosis, severity assessment, and prediction of treatment-related outcomes. However, current applications remain in early, pilot-stage development and are not yet suitable for clinical implementation. Future work should prioritize clinically meaningful tasks, scientifically rigorous and bias-aware methodologies, larger and more representative cohorts, and systematic external validation. Fairness, explainability, and reproducibility must be addressed to support translation. Continued methodological refinement and clinical grounding will be key to unlocking the potential of these technologies for this highly vulnerable patient population in the future.\n"}, "authors": [{"id": "2408034426", "name": "Sarah Elizabeth Long"}, {"id": "2279471138", "name": "T.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as one of the most influential technologies shaping the contemporary world. In the field of graphic design, AI has introduced new methods of visual creation, transformed traditional design processes and redefined the relationship between human creativity and digital tools. This research paper examines the role of artificial intelligence in graphic design, focusing on its impact on creativity, efficiency, innovation, and ethical considerations. AI-powered tools such as generative design systems, automated layout software, intelligent image-editing applications, and data-driven design platforms have enabled designers to work faster, experiment more freely, and produce personalized visual content. While these advancements enhance productivity and expand creative possibilities, they also raise concerns regarding originality, authorship, over-dependence on technology, and the potential dilution of human intuition. This study adopts a qualitative and analytical approach to explore the advantages and limitations of AI in graphic design. The paper argues that artificial intelligence should be perceived not as a replacement for designers, but as a collaborative partner that complements human imagination. Ultimately, the balanced integration of AI and human creativity can lead to a more adaptive, innovative, and ethically responsible future for graphic design."}, "authors": [{"id": "2406593874", "name": "Satyam Tripathi"}], "fields_of_study": null}

A mixed-methods intervention was conducted with 39 graduate students enrolled in the Master of Arts Major in Educational Management, who participated in a 20-hour AI literacy and ethics course embedded in a Graduate Seminar. To capture the Philippine education realities often overlooked in global frameworks, a researcher-developed questionnaire was employed to reconceptualize and measure AI literacy and ethical preparedness in the local context. Quantitative results showed significant improvements, with Artificial Intelligence literacy mediating the relationship between ethical preparedness and artificial intelligence literacy (β = .46, p < .001).

This study examines technostress among middle school teachers in the context of AI integration and explores how personal competence (including digital awareness, digital technology knowledge and skills, and digital application competence), role conflict, organizational support, and technological features influence technostress. Methods The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is employed as the theoretical underpinning for the present research, using survey data from 301 middle school teachers, a path model was constructed to analyze these relationships. Results The results indicate that the overall level of technostress is relatively low; however, different teacher groups experience distinct sources of stress. Specifically, appropriate technological features and strong digital awareness effectively alleviate technostress, while role conflict intensifies it. Furthermore, these factors play a significant mediating role between organizational support and technostress. Discussion Based on these findings, the study proposes several strategies to mitigate technostress among middle school teachers. First, a tiered and category based approach should be adopted to provide targeted support according to teachers’ actual needs. Second, it is important to balance the relationship between technological supply and educational demand to ensure sustainable implementation. Third, showcasing typical successful cases can help enhance teachers’ digital awareness and confidence in using AI. Finally, strengthen role positioning and work flexibility to ease teachers’ role conflict. These strategies offer practical guidance for educational administrators seeking to promote the effective integration of AI technologies in middle school education."}, "authors": [{"id": "2401913477", "name": "Chenguang Wu"}, {"id": "2248870169", "name": "Wenlan Zhang"}, {"id": "2265106112", "name": "Liangliang Hu"}, {"id": "2407407600", "name": "Ming Li"}], "fields_of_study": null}

The Indonesian legal system until now does not have a specific regulation that explicitly regulates the legal status of artificial intelligence, so the regulation still depends on Law Number 1 of 2024 concerning Electronic Information and Transactions which places artificial intelligence as part of the electronic system. This approach departs from the assumption of human control that is increasingly difficult to maintain as adaptive capabilities and independent decision-making by technology increases. This condition creates a legal vacuum that has an impact on the uncertainty of responsibility attribution when artificial intelligence causes legal consequences. This study aims to critically analyze the position of artificial intelligence in the Indonesian legal system, relevant legal accountability models, and the limitations of modern legal personification. The research method used is normative juridical with a legislative, conceptual, and analytical-critical approach. The results of the study show that granting the status of legal subjects to artificial intelligence has the potential to cause normative distortions and weaken the principle of human accountability.

To investigate this topic, this manuscript offers a first step in this conversation by analyzing the expectations and acceptance levels of the potential user base regarding the use of AI technology in organizational leadership positions. This was accomplished by surveying managers and staff (N = 74) using an online questionnaire that offered three fictitious scenarios with varying degrees of interaction with potential users in which AI handles specific managerial tasks. An analysis of variance revealed that among the scenarios, AI managers who function as (digital) cognitive agents had the highest acceptance levels.

The present work uses the filmic narrative of Annihilation (2018) to challenge the persistent dismissal of AI’s creative capabilities. Such skepticism often hinges on the problematic assumption that human traits—such as inspiration, intuition, consciousness, spontaneity, will, or emotion—are pre-requisites for creativity. This line of argumentation relies on an anthropomorphic approach that is unable to imagine or accept non-human modes of perception, cognition, and agency. Instead, the study first proposes adopting an apophatic approach, through which AI is defined not by the projection of human qualities but rather via negation, emphasizing what lies beyond human understanding. It then advocates for “alien phenomenology” as a method for accepting the non-human cognitive capabilities of AI. Accepting AI as an “alien intelligence” shifts the role of the artist toward critique and curation, underscoring the artistic talent in recognizing unexplored, alien forms of beauty."}, "authors": [{"id": "2406686358", "name": "Vahid Vahdat"}], "fields_of_study": null}

The RFs use environments simulated by three global artificial intelligence-based weather prediction (AIWP) models: PanguWeather, FourcastNet v2-small, and Graphcast. Individual hazard forecasts and any hazard forecasts are generated at all lead times and are compared to operational machine learning-based hazard guidance products from the Global Ensemble Forecast System Machine Learning Probabilities model. Skill metrics are computed for forecasts generated across 2024 and ensembles of RF forecasts are created for an example case to understand the value of AIWP-based machine learning guidance products. Skillful individual hazard forecasts were obtained out to day 7, but the operational machine learning guidance often performed better at longer lead times for the any hazard forecasts and at shorter lead times for individual hazards. Combining the AIWP inputs as a single metric (i.e., median) did overcome some of the deficiencies of single-AIWP RFs, although PanguWeather-RF forecasts were competitive with the median-based forecasts. Further, creating ensembles of AIWP predictions improved skill and generated distributions of severe weather potential, demonstrating a new avenue to exploit the utility and value of postprocessed AIWP systems."}, "authors": [{"id": "2404379081", "name": "Evan White"}, {"id": "2320953039", "name": "Aaron J.

This article addresses technological aspects of the extension by focusing attention on the complementary action (called augmentation) of artificial intelligence on the human mind and its consequences. While some of them result from the possibility of expanding human cognition, others concern agency, including moral agency. Extension in this context means restoration of the abilities that the human being has lost or equipping man with new competences. Developed within the philosophy of the human mind, the concept of the extended mind can be applied to reflections within the philosophy of technology, especially as our understanding of the correlation between man and the tools he uses is becoming clearer. Artificial intelligence is an artifact that expands and complements human thinking and acting in the context of collecting and organizing information. Importantly, artificial intelligence can significantly complement human creativity in the operational and combination dimension; moreover, it can suggest new and unconventional solutions. Artificial intelligence should be treated as a human creation, operating on the basis of the observed model of human skills and tasks formulated by the programmer or designer.

Artificial intelligence has the potential to be paradigm-changing; however, critical care clinicians have a long history of adopting new technologies that transform care delivery in remarkable ways. Just as introduction of the mechanical ventilator revolutionized life support, artificial intelligence promises to transform modern critical care by improving prediction of disease course and patient outcomes, supporting clinical decision-making, and optimizing clinician workflow, with future potential for autonomous therapeutic adjustments and personalized care. However, as with mechanical ventilation, adopting artificial intelligence as a new technology requires caution and rigorous validation. Key challenges include ensuring accountability, preventing algorithmic bias, maintaining patient safety, and preserving the human element in care. It is vital to maintain a human-centered approach, in which artificial intelligence serves as a tool to augment, not replace, the nuanced judgment of health care professionals. To navigate this transition, critical care clinicians must become literate in artificial intelligence, understanding the capabilities and limitations of these new tools. It is crucial to cultivate a critical mindset, continuously validating artificial intelligence outputs against clinical judgment. Integrating artificial intelligence into team workflows, developing clear ethical guidelines, and fostering collaboration between clinicians and data scientists are essential for successful implementation.

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technologies offers novel approaches to optimize real-time nitric oxide monitoring, dosing regimens, and toxicity prediction. Current interdisciplinary research on the artificial intelligence-driven nitric oxide intersection remains fragmented, with a lack of systematic investigations into knowledge architecture, technological evolution, and translational barriers. This study addressed this critical gap by presenting the knowledge graph-based analysis of artificial intelligence-driven nitric oxide system.

Annual publications demonstrated a biphasic growth, accelerating after 2017 in tandem with breakthroughs in artificial intelligence architectures. Although China and the United States were dominated in this field, international collaborations exhibited a core-periphery structure. Research themes predominantly focused on cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, with underdeveloped applications in neuroimmunology and infectious diseases. Highly cited literature that emphasized photodynamic therapy and disease risk assessment revealed insufficient integration between artificial intelligence algorithms and fundamental nitric oxide mechanisms. Keyword evolution analysis identified a paradigm shift from traditional mechanisms (e.g., \"blood pressure,\" \"inflammation\") to technology-driven approaches (e.g., \"machine learning, \" \"deep learning\"). Clinical translation has faced challenges, including data heterogeneity, algorithm interpretability, and deficiencies in multicenter validation.

The first analyzes the utilization of AI in the broader domain of Qurʾānic sciences, whereas the second focuses specifically on its application in various exegetical approaches.The study concludes that artificial intelligence can offer significant support to Qurʾānic scholarship by enhancing research efficiency, organization, and accessibility, provided its use is governed by clear academic and ethical guidelines. Chief among these is the requirement that all AI-generated or AI-assisted content related to tafsīr and Qurʾānic sciences be supervised, verified, and curated by qualified scholars with recognized expertise. Such oversight is essential to safeguard the accuracy, authenticity, and sanctity of Qurʾānic knowledge."}, "authors": [{"id": "2405167228", "name": "Rinda ʿAbd al-Raʾūf ʿAlī Ḥamad"}], "fields_of_study": null}

In the process of developing medical AI, there may arise not only legal risks such as infringement of privacy rights and health rights but also ethical risks stemming from violations of the principles of beneficence and non-maleficence. Methods: To effectively address the damages caused by MAI in the future, it is necessary to establish a hierarchical governance system with MAI. This paper examines the systematic collection of local practices in China and the induction and integration of legal remedies for the damage of MAI. Results: To effectively address the ethical and legal challenges of medical artificial intelligence, a hierarchical regulatory system should be established, which based on the impact of intervention measures on natural rights and differences in intervention timing. This paper finally obtains a legal hierarchical governance system corresponding to the ethical risks and legal risks of MAI in China.

The subject of the study is the relations arising in the process of such regulation. The purpose of the study is to analyze the legal regulation of the use of artificial intelligence in the process of collecting information about citizens, its processing and taking into account the decisions prepared by AI for law enforcement officials. The methodological basis of the study is logical and systematic methods of scientific cognition, as well as methods of analysis and synthesis of legal phenomena. Foreign and domestic experience of legal regulation is studied. Special attention is paid to the need to ensure the protection of citizens' rights in the process of collecting information about them, its processing and taking into account the decisions prepared by artificial intelligence for law enforcement officials. It is pointed out that the peculiarities of legal regulation in this sphere of life activity of society are conditioned by the correctness of conclusions formulated by artificial intelligence, as well as the competence of algorithm developers and persons carrying out its training. Legal regulation of the relevant relations is considered through the prism of the results of law enforcement. The Eastern approach assumes the assessment of the actions of individuals by a number of parameters, taking into account which their trustworthiness index is determined, implying the assignment of a personal id to them personal identification code (social rating). The Western approach is that the United States and Western states actively using digital control tools based on AI technologies in the field of law enforcement do not inform the population about the total surveillance of people. It is noted that at present the regulation of this sphere in the Russian Federation is more oriented to the Western approach. At the same time, at the national level there is no mechanism of legal regulation on the consequences of actions of a person in the field of law enforcement. Attention is drawn to the fact that while in China for “unreliable” persons only a number of restrictions are imposed on their movement (use of airplanes and trains), occupation (prohibition to hold managerial positions in certain areas), obtaining financial services (refusal to issue loans), in the United States such persons are placed without trial in secret prisons, where they are tortured. It is concluded that taking into account this circumstance requires the creation in the Russian Federation of a legal mechanism for appealing decisions taken by law enforcement officials on the basis of recommendations developed by artificial intelligence, by developing and adopting norms of law to prevent the use of its potential for purposes incompatible with the goals of law enforcement. This implies the need to develop a system of theoretical ideas about the most rational forms and methods of legal regulation in considering."}, "authors": [{"id": "2404345536", "name": "Oleg A.

A \"staged and typed imputation model\" should be established: in the research and development stage, the principle of technological neutrality should be applied in principle, and only acts of intentionally manufacturing infringing tools should be held accountable as exceptions; in the use stage, the focus should be on regulating users with subjective malicious intent who meet the crime quantity standards.

This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for failure-aware artificial intelligence, encompassing systematic mechanisms for detecting, categorizing, and responding to failures in deployed AI systems. We propose a three-tier failure taxonomy that distinguishes between input-level anomalies, processing-level errors, and output-level inconsistencies, each requiring distinct detection and recovery strategies. The proposed architecture integrates continuous self-monitoring components, confidence estimation modules, and adaptive recovery mechanisms that enable graceful degradation rather than catastrophic failure. Building upon prior work in modular robotic system architectures and patented approaches to dexterous task execution, we present design principles for building failure-resilient AI systems, including redundancy patterns, fallback hierarchies, and human-in-the-loop escalation protocols. Evaluation through simulated failure injection across multiple AI task domains demonstrates that failure-aware systems maintain operational continuity in 87% of induced failure scenarios, compared to 23% for conventional architectures. The framework provides practitioners with actionable guidelines for enhancing the robustness and reliability of deployed artificial intelligence systems across diverse application contexts."}, "authors": [{"id": "2406805802", "name": "Ashis Ghosh"}], "fields_of_study": null}

This paper surveys the rapidly expanding body of literature examining the relationship between AI and entrepreneurial activity, offering a comprehensive reference for scholars in entrepreneurship and related fields. The review begins by critically examining existing definitions of AI, highlighting how conceptual ambiguity and overly broad operationalization in empirical research may obscure a clear understanding of AI’s entrepreneurial impacts. Building on this foundation, the paper synthesizes theoretical and empirical insights on the influence of AI on entrepreneurial opportunity recognition, decision-making under uncertainty, technology adoption by startups, entry barriers, and firm performance. Drawing on empirical evidence from the German Socio-Economic Panel, the study demonstrates that entrepreneurs—particularly those employing workers—exhibit significantly higher awareness and usage of AI technologies than paid employees. The analysis further explores indirect effects of AI on entrepreneurship through changes in local and sectoral labor markets. Evidence suggests that automation-oriented AI tends to increase necessity-driven entrepreneurship, whereas AI that augments or transforms jobs fosters opportunity-based entrepreneurial activity. Additionally, AI reshapes regional entrepreneurial ecosystems by reconfiguring existing elements, generating new processes, and potentially diminishing the importance of geographical proximity. Finally, the paper examines the implications of AI regulation for entrepreneurship, with particular reference to the European Union’s data protection and AI governance frameworks. The study concludes by outlining key implications for future entrepreneurship research and policy formulation.\n\nKeywords: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Entrepreneurial Decision-Making, AI Adoption, Entrepreneurial Performance"}, "authors": [{"id": "2406886961", "name": "S.

Our prior research identified this fragmentation paradox, revealing that 91.5% of urban AI implementations operate at the lowest levels of integration. While the Urban Systems Artificial Intelligence Framework (UAIF) offers a technical blueprint for integration, realizing this vision is contingent upon organizational readiness. This paper addresses this critical gap by introducing the Urban AI Governance Maturity Model (UAIG), developed using a Design Science Research methodology. Distinguished from generic maturity models, the UAIG operationalizes Socio-Technical Systems theory by establishing a direct Governance-Technology Interlock that specifically links organizational maturity levels to the engineering requirements of cross-domain AI. The model defines five maturity levels across five critical dimensions: Strategy and Investment; Organizational Structure and Culture; Data Governance and Policy; Technical Capacity and Interoperability; and Trust, Ethics, and Security.

Introduction\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved into a transformative force in radiology, complementing human intelligence across the entire imaging workflow. Current applications range from image acquisition and reconstruction to automated detection, quantification, triage, and clinical decision support. Evidence to date demonstrates that AI systems can match or exceed human performance in narrowly defined tasks, particularly in pattern recognition and workflow optimization. However, robust prospective validation, demonstration of clinical impact, and proof of generalizability across institutions and populations remain limited.\nHuman intelligence continues to play a central role in contextual interpretation, integration of clinical information, ethical judgment, and responsibility for patient care. Rather than replacing radiologists, AI is increasingly viewed as an augmentative tool that enhances diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and consistency when appropriately implemented.\nRegulatory frameworks are evolving in response to these developments. In Europe, the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and the forthcoming AI Act introduce stricter requirements for transparency, risk classification, post-market surveillance, and human oversight. Comparable regulatory efforts are underway globally, aiming to balance innovation with patient safety, data protection, and accountability. Nonetheless, regulatory heterogeneity and the dynamic nature of adaptive AI systems pose ongoing challenges.\nLooking ahead, the future of radiology will be shaped by closer human–AI collaboration, increased emphasis on explainability, continuous learning systems under regulatory control, and higher-quality clinical evidence. Education and training of radiologists in AI literacy will be essential. Ultimately, the successful integration of artificial intelligence into radiology will depend not only on technological progress, but also on evidence-based implementation, clear regulation, and sustained human expertise.\n2. Methods and Sources\nThe present article is based on a curated, critical analysis of recent high-quality literature addressing the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology. The purpose of this chapter is not to provide a systematic review in the strict methodological sense, but rather to transparently describe the sources used and to analyze how contemporary publications conceptualize, evaluate, and contextualize AI within clinical radiology. Emphasis is placed on methodological rigor, evidence generation, human–AI interaction, and regulatory framing.\nThe selected time frame (2022–2025) captures a period that followed an initial phase of considerable enthusiasm surrounding AI in radiology. During the years preceding this interval, AI was frequently portrayed as a disruptive technology with the potential to fundamentally transform diagnostic imaging, often accompanied by claims of near-human or superhuman performance. More recent publications, however, reflect a noticeable shift toward a more cautious and sober assessment. This phase is characterized by increased attention to real-world performance, unintended consequences of AI deployment, limitations of retrospective evidence, and the growing influence of regulatory requirements (11).\nAgainst this background, the present analysis aims to examine how leading journals and expert groups currently approach AI in radiology, how evidence is generated and reported, and where persistent gaps and inconsistencies remain. The overarching perspective is radiological and clinical, with patient safety, accountability, and feasibility of implementation taking precedence over technological optimism.\n2.1 Literature identification and selection strategy\nThe literature corpus consists of twelve peer-reviewed publications published between 2022 and 2025. Sources were selected from internationally recognized journals with high relevance for clinical radiology, medical imaging research, digital medicine, and health technology assessment. These include Nature Medicine, Radiology, The Lancet Digital Health, European Radiology, npj Digital Medicine, Insights into Imaging, The British Journal of Radiology, and Value in Health (1–12).\nSelection criteria focused on publications that met at least one of the following conditions:\n(a) presentation of original clinical or reader-based evidence on AI performance in radiology,\n(b) methodological or reporting frameworks for clinical evaluation of AI systems,\n(c) health-economic evaluation standards applicable to AI-based interventions, or\n(d) regulatory and legal analyses with direct relevance to radiological practice.\nPurely technical machine-learning papers without clinical validation, as well as non–peer-reviewed industry reports, were deliberately excluded.\nThe final selection reflects four thematic clusters: clinical evidence and human–AI interaction (7, 8, 10, 12), methodological and reporting standards (4 – 6), regulatory and governance perspectives (7 – 10, 12), and critical commentaries offering a meta-level appraisal of the current state of AI in radiology (11). This approach allows a balanced view across the AI life cycle, from development and evaluation to implementation and oversight.\n2.2 Types of publications and study designs\nThe analyzed literature demonstrates substantial heterogeneity with regard to publication type and study design. Original clinical evidence is predominantly derived from retrospective cohort studies and reader studies, often using enriched or curated datasets. A representative example is the large retrospective screening study evaluating AI as an independent or assisting reader in breast cancer screening, which relies on historical mammography data with long-term follow-up (2). Similarly, real-world validation studies in specific disease contexts, such as multiple sclerosis MRI monitoring, remain largely retrospective and context-specific (3).\nReader studies assessing human–AI interaction frequently employ simulated reading environments or controlled experimental designs. While these approaches allow detailed analysis of performance metrics and behavioral effects, they inherently differ from routine clinical conditions (1). Prospective randomized trials remain rare, and when present, are often limited to narrow use cases or specific screening settings.\nA substantial portion of the literature consists of methodological guidance documents and reporting standards, including frameworks for clinical evaluation (4), early-stage decision support assessment (5), and health-economic reporting (6). These publications are normative in nature and aim to raise the methodological bar for future studies rather than to provide empirical performance data.\nRegulatory and legal analyses form another important category. These papers interpret evolving regulatory frameworks, particularly within the European context, and translate legal requirements into practical implications for radiologists and healthcare institutions (7,  10, 12). Finally, critical commentaries synthesize existing evidence and explicitly challenge prevailing assumptions about efficiency gains, economic benefits, and the transformative impact of AI in routine radiology (11).\n2.3 Conceptualization of artificial intelligence in the literature\nAcross the analyzed publications, AI is consistently conceptualized as a "}, "authors": [{"id": "2301284992", "name": "Z.

The results show that technologies such as machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing can effectively improve the efficiency and service level of garden management. Specifically, the intelligent planning system can optimize the spatial layout of the garden; the plant identification and health monitoring system can achieve precise maintenance; and the intelligent guide and recommendation system can provide personalized services. However, the application of technology still faces challenges such as data acquisition, algorithm optimization, and ethical privacy. Future research should focus on multi-source heterogeneous data fusion, deep learning model optimization, and human-computer collaboration mechanisms to promote the deep integration of artificial intelligence and landscape architecture management and build a smart, efficient, and sustainable modern garden management system.

The increasing volume of imaging studies has intensified interest in artificial intelligence algorithms as tools to improve detection accuracy, reduce interobserver variability, and optimize workflow efficiency in thoracic radiology. Objective: The main objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the impact of artificial intelligence algorithms on the detection and characterization of pulmonary nodules in chest computed tomography. Secondary objectives include assessing diagnostic accuracy compared with human readers, analyzing performance across different nodule sizes and types, evaluating effects on radiologist workflow, examining generalizability across populations and scanners, and summarizing current limitations and regulatory considerations. Methods: A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Studies published within the last five years were prioritized, with extension up to ten years if necessary, and eligibility criteria focused on human studies evaluating artificial intelligence–based algorithms for pulmonary nodule detection or characterization on chest computed tomography. Data synthesis followed PRISMA recommendations with structured qualitative analysis. Results and Discussion: A total of 20 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final review. Overall, artificial intelligence algorithms demonstrated high sensitivity for pulmonary nodule detection, particularly for small and subsolid nodules, and showed consistent improvements in reader performance when used as decision-support tools. Variability in study design, reference standards, and outcome reporting contributed to moderate heterogeneity, but most studies supported a complementary role for artificial intelligence in clinical practice rather than full replacement of expert interpretation.Conclusion: Current evidence suggests that artificial intelligence algorithms can enhance the detection and characterization of pulmonary nodules on chest computed tomography, especially when integrated into radiologist workflows. While promising, their clinical implementation requires careful validation, transparency, and alignment with evidence-based guidelines to ensure safe and effective use."}, "authors": [{"id": "2405463996", "name": "Daniella Nogueira Ferreira"}, {"id": "2405460473", "name": "Caio Fogaça Prates"}, {"id": "2405463975", "name": "Vivian Gomes da Silva Oliveira"}], "fields_of_study": null}

However, its integration into clinical practice raises complex ethical challenges that must be addressed to ensure responsible and equitable use. This chapter aims to explore the ethical implications of AI in surgery through the lens of the four foundational principles of medical ethics: autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. Respecting patient autonomy requires clinicians to disclose all relevant information and ensure understanding of a proposed intervention (or AI tool) for a patient to make an informed, voluntary decision. Numerous studies have shown that both patients and clinicians often lack sufficient understanding of AI tools, complicating efforts to explain their intended function, or obtain truly informed consent for their use in patient care. This has the potential to diminish trust in the patient–clinician relationship and must be considered when using AI tools. AI's potential to uphold beneficence is evident in its ability to enhance surgical precision and outcomes. Yet, its reliance on historical data introduces risks of bias and error, threatening the principle of nonmaleficence. In this chapter, we explore these topics further to highlight the need for robust oversight and clinician involvement to prevent harm to patients. When biased data are used to train an AI tool, it may lead to unequal care across patient populations—i.e., exacerbating existing disparities in health care. Additionally, the lack of clear accountability for AI-driven errors raises legal and ethical concerns about liability—whether it lies with clinicians, health care institutions, or developers. To ethically integrate AI into surgical practice, the chapter calls for comprehensive frameworks that ensure transparency, data integrity, clinician and patient education, and regulatory oversight. These measures are essential to safeguard patient welfare as AI continues to reshape the future of surgical care."}, "authors": [{"id": "2284746396", "name": "Nicole Meredyth"}, {"id": "2384422148", "name": "Paola A.

Various doctrinal conceptions about whether artificial intelligence is a separate legal subject or not and competing approaches to defining its legal status, the notions of an “electronic person” and a “quasi-subject” in particular, are analyzed. The conclusion is that it is necessary to establish an effective legal framework to regulate the use of artificial intelligence technologies based on an anthropocentric approach that places the protection of human rights and interests at the forefront of all interactions with technology.

Based on the reviewed experience of their application in the Ministry of Finance of Russia, the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia, and the Ministry of Digital Development of Russia, it seems that the questions of using artificial intelligence in the management of program expenditures of the federal budget require a comprehensive theoretical and legal understanding. During the examination, the author conducted an analysis of the implementation of artificial intelligence technologies in the format of the Electronic Budget 2.0. As a result of the analysis, the author presents proposals for the further functioning of artificial intelligence technologies in the process of developing and executing state programs of the Russian Federation within the framework of the budget process, as well as recommendations for updating the existing regulatory legal foundations for regulating artificial intelligence in the budget process. The study applied formal legal, comparative legal, and systemic methods, as well as methods of legal modeling and analysis of law enforcement practice. The analysis utilized legal acts, program documents, and official materials from federal executive authorities, along with a generalization of departmental experience in implementing artificial intelligence technologies in the budget process. The scientific novelty of the study lies in the comprehensive theoretical and legal analysis of the use of artificial intelligence technologies in managing program expenditures of the federal budget, taking into account the specifics of the digital transformation of the budget process. For the first time, the approaches of the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation, and the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media of the Russian Federation to the implementation of artificial intelligence at various stages of managing program expenditures have been systematized and compared. It is substantiated that artificial intelligence can serve as an effective tool for reducing procedural costs in the budget process without redistributing budgetary powers and substituting the discretion of officials. The conclusion is drawn about the necessity of forming special legal regulations for the application of intelligent services in the \"Electronic Budget\" system, including establishing their status, requirements for transparency and verifiability of algorithms, as well as a clear delineation of responsibility between humans and AI."}, "authors": [{"id": "2406893904", "name": "Dmitrii Sergeevich Samorodskii"}], "fields_of_study": null}

This work is underpinned by an extensive set of references.\n\nExecutive Summary\nThe current impact of AI on SES is illustrated through material on digital twins, virtual and augmented reality, smart clothes and the ‘Internet of Things’, and markerless motion capture. AI’s potential transformative impact on SES resulting from the development of large language models is explored, emphasising the importance of the human-in-the-loop.\n\nSeveral AI tools that can be used for research in SES are presented. These fall into four main categories: literature review; data analysis; report writing; and grant acquisition.\n\nAI is reshaping higher education teaching and assessment by generating lessons, scaffolding explanations for diverse learners, creating quizzes, and drafting formative feedback. Academics must shape environments that ensure AI is used ethically and constructively.\n\nSports-performance AI now delivers real-time analysis of physiology, biomechanics, tactics, and injury risk. Simulated environments and reinforcement-learning ‘next-play’ models safely let coaches test tactics and opponent behaviour. Practitioners must rigorously evaluate these tools to ensure responsible, ethical use that prioritises athlete wellbeing and performance.\n\nThe use of wearable technology to monitor and evaluate sport and fitness activity has become ever-present. Using AI and big data appears to have promising applications within health and fitness, but increased consideration of human factors may be needed to develop this technology further.\n\nAI systems in exercise prescription are increasingly integrated into clinical and fitness settings to provide scalable and personalised exercise offerings. Many of these AI systems are rooted in the biomedical model, focusing on measurable outcomes like heart rate. Expanding their design to incorporate recreational, social and nature-based activities such as ‘green’ and ‘blue’ prescriptions might improve their impact on public health.\n\nAI can inform ethical thinking but cannot be relied on to be ethical, fair, or to embody professional values. Ethical decisions remain a human responsibility.\n\nSES faces several challenges if it is to ensure that AI has a positive impact on the profession. These include but are not limited to:\n\npreparing the next generation of professionals\nestablishing what best practice in SES looks like in the use of AI\npreparing for other technological developments that will emerge because of, or alongside, AI.\n\n\nAI is better than human ignorance but not human reasoning or uniquely human qualities.

Specific Background: Coding and artificial intelligence learning have been introduced in elementary schools as concrete approaches to support computational thinking through meaningful and contextual learning experiences. Knowledge Gap: Previous studies in Indonesia largely emphasize technical implementation or teacher training, while limited attention has been given to pedagogical strategies grounded in deep learning approaches for fostering computational thinking at the elementary level. Aims: This study explores deep learning–based coding and artificial intelligence learning strategies for developing computational thinking among elementary school students in North Serpong District. Results: Using a descriptive qualitative approach involving teachers and students from two elementary schools, the findings indicate that learning strategies emphasizing active participation, problem solving, reflection, and contextual activities support students’ ability to decompose problems, recognize patterns, construct abstractions, and formulate algorithmic steps. Variations in computational thinking development were observed across schools, reflecting differences in learning implementation quality. Novelty: This study confirms that deep learning–based coding and artificial intelligence learning demonstrates differentiated reinforcement across computational thinking dimensions according to contextual implementation in elementary classrooms. Implications: The findings position deep learning–based coding and artificial intelligence as a strategic pedagogical alternative for strengthening computational thinking and digital literacy within elementary education.\nHighlights\n• Computational Thinking Developed Through Contextual Coding Activities• Deep Learning Approach Supports Reflective And Meaningful Learning• Differentiated Implementation Shapes Student Learning Outcomes\nKeywords\nCoding Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Deep Learning; Computational Thinking; Elementary School"}, "authors": [{"id": "2079084654", "name": "Ainul Mardhiyah"}, {"id": "2407923158", "name": "Muhamad Sofian Hadi"}, {"id": "2134518086", "name": "Misriandi Misriandi"}], "fields_of_study": null}

This study aims to leverage the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technologies to establish a dynamic, precise system for sports injury prediction and prevention, thereby reducing injury rates and enhancing rehabilitation strategies. A comprehensive sports injury feature database was developed by integrating multi-source data, including physiological parameters collected from wearable devices, biomechanical data from video motion capture systems, and clinical rehabilitation records. Machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, were employed to identify and analyze key risk factors for injuries, such as peak joint load and muscle fatigue index. Model performance was further optimized through A/B testing and cross-validation. Longitudinal cohort tracking of athletes was conducted, and the effectiveness of intervention measures was validated through a real-time feedback system. The AI-driven model demonstrated a predictive accuracy of 89.7% (AUC = 0.93), representing a substantial improvement over traditional methods, which achieved only 72.4% accuracy. For chronic injuries such as ankle instability, personalized intervention protocols led to a 34% reduction in recurrence rates. The exoskeleton-assisted rehabilitation system enhanced gait correction efficiency by 41% while simultaneously reducing recovery time. Furthermore, multimodal data fusion techniques successfully identified 15 high-risk movement patterns, providing objective, data-driven insights to optimize training regimens. The integration of AI and big data technologies facilitates the early detection and precise prevention of sports injuries through dynamic monitoring and sophisticated pattern recognition. Despite these advances, challenges related to data privacy, interdisciplinary collaboration, and algorithm transparency remain. Future research should focus on expanding the diversity of sample populations and exploring the potential application of AI in sports psychology interventions.

Breast cancer treatments vary, with surgery being one of them. \nIn this review, we aim to evaluate artificial Intelligence’s ability to predict surgical outcomes, complications, and survival rates after breast cancer surgery by analyzing original research conducted over the last 5 years. \nMaterials and Methods: A PubMed search was conducted by two authors from January 1, 2020, to April 13, 2025, using the keywords \"Artificial Intelligence\" and \"Breast Surgery\". After elimination, 14 of the 215 articles were full-text screened, and nine original articles were selected for inclusion in our review. \nDiscussion: Artificial intelligence models and systems have had a significant impact on the medical field, and breast cancer surgery is no exception. Several original research studies have explored AI's ability to predict surgical outcomes and postoperative results. In this review, we focus on the postoperative aspects of breast cancer surgery and its application of artificial intelligence.  \nOf the nine articles included in this paper, all reported multiple statistically significant results (p <0.05). Although no prospective research directly compares artificial intelligence with practicing physicians, artificial intelligence’s ability to accurately predict surgical outcomes, complications, and survival has shown higher accuracy and c-index than commonly used prediction methods, as reported in multiple studies. \nConclusion: Artificial Intelligence can be a valuable asset in helping surgeons and medical doctors worldwide predict prognosis with improved systems and accuracy rates, even surpassing those of currently used conservative systems. There is a lack of information on PubMed regarding the comparison of these two aspects, particularly with larger sample sizes. More research should be conducted on this topic, particularly in comparing Artificial Intelligence systems and models with current systems and evaluation methods."}, "authors": [{"id": "2247753801", "name": "Abdullah Emre Akşun"}, {"id": "2405952542", "name": "İsmail Canbaş"}, {"id": "2405945123", "name": "Arda Işık"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Utilizing Claude 3 Opus as the primary artificial intelligence tool, the research compares artificial intelligence-generated feedback to traditional teacher-provided dynamic written corrective feedback within a 15-week intensive English program involving intermediate-high learners of English as a second language (\n n\n  = 41). Using a quasi-experimental design, participants were randomly assigned to a control (teacher-based feedback) and treatment (artificial intelligence-based feedback) groups. Multiple metrics were used to assess second language writing development, including the error-free clause ratio, fluency, syntactic complexity (mean length of T-unit and clauses per T-unit), and rubric-based functional adequacy. Findings from repeated measures analysis of variance indicated that although both groups receiving dynamic written corrective feedback improved in writing accuracy, the teacher feedback group outperformed the artificial intelligence group in fluency and functional adequacy. No significant differences were observed for measures of syntactic complexity. Sentiment analysis revealed mixed reactions: although most students found artificial intelligence-based feedback helpful and easy to use, 27% of their commentary expressed concerns regarding feedback accuracy and clarity. Teachers echoed these concerns, citing some inconsistencies and student confusion. Additionally, the study compared Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and ChatGPT-4 in their ability to identify errors. Results suggest Sonnet may outperform Opus and ChatGPT-4, although unexpected autocorrections by Claude models introduced reliability concerns. These findings suggest that although artificial intelligence tools like Claude 3 Opus may facilitate writing accuracy gains comparable to those achieved through teacher feedback, they could inadvertently hinder other aspects of writing development. Given ongoing advancements in generative artificial intelligence, further research is warranted to explore whether newer models employing test-time compute or generative reasoning can offer improved dynamic written corrective feedback quality without compromising fluency or functional adequacy.\n"}, "authors": [{"id": "144410821", "name": "K.

Artificial intelligence methods of data collection provide an opportunity to fill this gap by combining heterogeneous information that applies to hazard and exposure. In paper, a designed analytical framework of artificial intelligence was created to evaluate and rank the possible human health hazards of the representative emerging contaminants of the chosen artificial intelligence through combined physicochemical descriptors, toxicological bioassay indicators, and exposure related parameters. Several simple machine learning models such as logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting and deep neural networks were trained and assessed through repeated cross validation to offer statistical soundness and to reduce overfitting. Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were used to measure model performance. The ensemble random forest model had shown excellent and statistically significant performance with an average classification accuracy of about 85 percent, recall of more than 0.85 with high-risk contaminants and an area under curve of near 0.90 with each fold of validation showing strong discriminating capacity. Explainable artificial intelligence analyses indicated that least amount of lipophilicity, environmental persistence, signs of endocrine related biological activity, and the intensity of use or production were the most important contributors to risk classification and together, they explained most of the model explaining power. Comprehensively, these results can be used to understand that statistically sound artificial intelligence models can be successful in the recognition and rank of potential human health interest emerging contaminants."}, "authors": [{"id": "2346225344", "name": "Joseph Ozigis Akomodi"}, {"id": "2376592755", "name": "Birupaksha Biswas"}], "fields_of_study": null}

AI-based approaches may assist clinical and genetic diagnosis from phenotypic data; however, early phenotype-driven tools have seen limited clinician adoption due to modest accuracy, usability challenges, and poor workflow integration. Electrophysiological studies remain central to diagnosing neuromuscular diseases, and AI shows promise for accurate classification of electrophysiological signals. Predictive models for disease outcome and progression—particularly in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis—are under active investigation, but most remain at an early stage of development and are not yet ready for routine clinical use. Digital biomarkers derived from imaging, gait, voice, and wearable sensors are emerging, with MRI-based quantification of muscle fat replacement representing the most mature and widely accepted application to date. Efforts to apply AI to therapeutic discovery, including drug repurposing and optimization of gene-based therapies, are ongoing but have thus far yielded limited clinical translation. Persistent barriers to broader adoption include disease rarity, data scarcity, heterogeneous acquisition protocols, inconsistent terminology, limited external validation, insufficient model explainability, and lack of seamless integration into clinical workflows. Addressing these challenges is essential to moving AI tools from the laboratory into clinical practice. We conclude with a practical checklist of considerations intended to guide the development and adoption of AI tools in neuromuscular disease care."}, "authors": [{"id": "2285616878", "name": "D. C.

Five databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar) were searched from 2015 to 2025. Of 413 records, 32 studies met inclusion and most were single-center, retrospective investigations in reproductive-age cohorts. Ultrasound predominated (50%), followed by laparoscopic imaging (25%) and MRI (22%); ovarian endometrioma and deep infiltrating endometriosis were the most commonly modeled phenotypes. Classification was the dominant AI task (78%), typically using convolutional neural networks (often ResNet-based), whereas segmentation (31%) and object detection (3%) were less explored. Nearly all studies relied on internal validation (97%), most frequently simple hold-out splits with heterogeneous, accuracy-focused performance reporting. The minimal AI-method quality appraisal identified frequent methodological gaps across key domains, including limited reporting of patient-level separation, leakage safeguards, calibration, and data and code availability.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a tool to supplement these interactions by improving perioperative risk communication, tailoring patient education, and reducing physician workload. Current applications include chatbots for preconsultation history gathering, AI-generated decision aids, and risk prediction models, which synthesize large datasets to provide individualized outcome predictions. Visualization platforms and large language model-driven documents further demonstrate potential to improve readability, completeness, and patient comprehension compared with traditional surgeon-generated materials. Research suggests that AI may enhance shared decision-making by increasing patient understanding, reducing decisional conflict, and supporting individualized risk-benefit discussions. Populations with complex needs—including patients with multiple comorbidities, limited English proficiency, or low health literacy—may experience particular benefit from AI-assisted communication. Indirect advantages are also evident; studies of ambient AI scribes report decreased documentation burden, reduced after-hours work, and improved patient engagement, suggesting downstream improvements in the patient–physician relationship. Despite these promising developments, limitations persist. AI models are prone to bias and lack transparency, raising concerns regarding fairness, accuracy, and trustworthiness. Overreliance on AI risks diminishing essential human elements of care, while errors in translation or misrepresentation of nuance may disproportionately affect vulnerable groups. Ensuring robust evaluation, representative training datasets, and clinician oversight is critical to safe implementation. AI tools show substantial promise in improving surgical communication, but more research is required to establish their effectiveness, address ethical challenges, and define best practices for integration into clinical care."}, "authors": [{"id": "2403476074", "name": "Elizabeth A.

Thus, this study detects the ability of different AI assistants to produce indirect language. 50 questions of various types were asked to different AI assistants like DeepSeek, Gemini and Chat GPT. The results show that all the three programs use indirect language strategies and devices, yet, they vary in the usage. ChatGPT’s language is more indirect than Gemini and Deepseek. It uses assertives qualified with epistemic hedges and exhibits negative politeness as well as different linguistic markers. In contrast, DeepSeek’s language is direct and authorative as it uses clear assertive language and limited use of hedges. Gemini occupied a middle position for its indirectness remained less sophisticated and less frequent than that of ChatGPT."}, "authors": [{"id": "2408043744", "name": "Noor Salim Al-Asadi"}], "fields_of_study": null}

This study introduces an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for age-stratified mental health risk prediction using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). Using the Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI) dataset, the study stratifies individuals into five different age groups (18-55+ years) and applies machine learning models - Random Forest, extreme gradient boosting, and support vector machine - enhanced with SHAP to identify key predictors across life stages. The findings reveal significant variations in risk factors: younger adults (18-24) are influenced by social support, while familial history and past mental health disorders gain prominence in middle-aged groups (25-54). For older adults (55+), social networks and environmental stressors become critical. Unlike traditional «black box» AI models, SHAP provides interpretable insights, ensuring transparency in predictive decision-making. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating that mental health risks are not static but evolve with age, necessitating tailored interventions. The framework advances age-specific predictive modelling and offers actionable insights for policymakers and clinicians, particularly in resource-constrained settings. By addressing the limitations of conventional AI approaches, this research establishes a foundation for personalised, explainable, and effective mental health risk assessment across diverse populations. The integration of XAI with age stratification sets a new benchmark for mental health research, highlighting the transformative potential of AI-driven, context-sensitive solutions in addressing the global burden of mental health disorders."}, "authors": [{"id": "2222068278", "name": "Tsholofelo Mokheleli"}], "fields_of_study": null}

However, research indicates that preschool teachers often have limited awareness and literacy regarding AI, and studies focusing on improving their AI‐related knowledge remain insufficient. Therefore, enhancing preschool teachers' understanding of AI and supporting its effective integration into educational practices is critically important. This study aimed to examine the impact of an artificial intelligence education programme on preschool teachers' AI awareness. The study was conducted using a quasi‐experimental pre‐test–post‐test control group design and included a total of 48 preschool teachers, with 24 assigned to the experimental group and 24 to the control group. Teachers in the experimental group participated in artificial intelligence education applications, while no such interventions were implemented in the control group. Data were collected using measurement tools administered before and after the intervention. The findings revealed a statistically significant increase in artificial intelligence literacy among teachers in the experimental group compared to those in the control group. These results suggest that artificial intelligence–based educational interventions are effective in improving preschool teachers' awareness and understanding of AI, and they highlight the importance of incorporating AI education into professional development programmes for early childhood educators."}, "authors": [{"id": "2350281570", "name": "Yunus Emre Özenoğlu"}, {"id": "2074411082", "name": "F.

This interaction began with the early arrival of Islam through Yemeni merchants and preachers who carried the scholarly legacy of Shāfiʿī jurisprudence and Sunni Sufism. The research explores the concept of Malay Islamic knowledge and investigates how it responds to the profound transformations brought about by artificial intelligence, as an intellectual product reflecting the unique experience of Islamic communities in the Malay world. The study aims to define Malay Islamic knowledge and analyze the challenges and opportunities imposed by the rise of artificial intelligence on its structure and functions. It proposes a Maqāṣid-based framework for renewing this knowledge and ensuring its continuity by integrating research induction with linguistic and historical analysis, grounded in scriptural texts and the principles of Islamic law. Artificial intelligence is viewed not as a threat, but as a tool that can be harnessed to serve Islamic knowledge in a manner compatible with contemporary needs while preserving Islamic foundations and values. The research presents a Maqāṣid-oriented approach capable of accommodating digital transformations, relying on higher objectives of Sharia and legal maxims to guide renewal and regulate engagement with modern technologies. It concludes that Malay Islamic knowledge—with its civilizational uniqueness, historical depth, and well-established Sharīʿah objectives—is well-positioned to provide a knowledge model capable of contributing to the renewal and development of Islamic thought, and guiding the interaction with technological changes. This is achieved through a civilizational renewal project that safeguards foundational constants, directs evolving variables, and employs artificial intelligence in a conscious, Maqāṣid-based manner, enabling this knowledge to play an effective role in shaping Islamic civilization, preserving identity, and confronting cultural alienation."}, "authors": [{"id": "2316077071", "name": "A.

However, research on how these technologies is integrated into pre-service and in-service teacher training remains fragmented, with limited synthesis across pedagogical, psychological, and institutional dimensions. This systematic review synthesizes empirical evidence (2025) on the integration of GenAI and digital simulations in teacher training programmes, examining their effects on pedagogical competencies, digital readiness, and professional identity formation. The bibliographic coupling results show that the included studies cluster into four main intellectual groups. The strongest cluster focuses on teaching and learning foundations, reflecting shared pedagogical references. A second cluster centres on teacher education and professional development, linked through TPACK, readiness, and adoption models. A third cluster connects curriculum and subject-specific research, while a fourth highlights technology-driven studies on AI, VR/AR, and digital learning environments. Together, these clusters illustrate both a common theoretical base and growing diversification in AI-related teacher education research. GenAI emerged as a pedagogical partner that enhances lesson planning, differentiation, feedback, and teacher self-directed professional development. Digital simulations, including VR, avatar-based environments, and 3D modelling, supported communication skills, design thinking, and scenario-based decision-making. Across studies, teachers displayed curiosity and optimism but lacked comprehensive AI literacy, with readiness shaped by TPACK profiles, digital-competence frameworks, TAM and TPB constructs, and evolving professional identities. Key barriers included infrastructure inequality, insufficient training, overreliance on self-report outcomes, and concerns about creativity, authenticity, and ethical use. Teacher education programmes must embed structured AI-literacy curricula, model AI-rich instruction, ensure equitable access to technological infrastructure, and strengthen institutional support systems. Policy frameworks should incorporate ethical guidelines, assessment standards, and mechanisms for sustained professional development. AI-enabled teacher training holds substantial potential to enhance pedagogical competence and reshape professional identity. Yet its effectiveness depends on long-term integration, rigorous evaluation, and equitable implementation. Coordinated curricular, institutional, and policy reforms are essential for translating AI innovation into meaningful and sustainable teacher development."}, "authors": [{"id": "2271386361", "name": "Nirumala Rothinam"}, {"id": "2363478296", "name": "Rama Vengrasalam"}, {"id": "2363478298", "name": "Samikannu Jabamoney"}, {"id": "49335960", "name": "Sivabala Naidu"}, {"id": "2255025305", "name": "R.

The study compares personalized ML models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) with wavelet decomposition–based optimized approaches and further analyzes the performance of Hilbert transform–based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, label-free autoencoder frameworks, and multi-architecture DL systems in contemporary brain–computer interface (BCI) applications. In addition, incremental learning models based on multimodal data fusion are reviewed in the context of diagnosing disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and epilepsy. The findings indicate that EEG–AI integration holds substantial potential for both research and clinical applications."}, "authors": [{"id": "2407600592", "name": "Ahmet Husrev Akdeniz"}, {"id": "2288707473", "name": "Can Bülent Fidan"}], "fields_of_study": null}

However, traditional bicycle designs exhibit notable deficiencies in functionality, personalization, and health management. While artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been extensively applied in various fields, including professional cycling competitions like the Tour de France, its potential to introduce new possibilities to MC remains uncertain. Therefore, we undertook a comprehensive investigation into the impact and application of AI on the development of MC, aiming to facilitate the digital and intelligent transformation of MC. Method: We selected representative bicycle enterprises and related projects in the application of AI, including Specialized, Trek, Giant, Garmin, and some mass-based bicycle races for research. Using the principle of comparative experiments, we collected and compared multiple data in aspects such as the evaluation of riding performance (average riding distance, average riding speed, fatigue, etc.), user satisfaction, and the participation rate in races of MC under the circumstances of traditional mode and the AI-based mode through web information queries, DeepSeek, SPSS, and Tableau. Thus, we analyzed the impact of AI on the development of MC and made an objective summary. The research shows (compared with the traditional mode): (1) AI analyzes users' body shapes, skeletal features, riding habits, etc., through deep learning algorithms to customize bicycles on a personalized basis. (User satisfaction increased by 92%, the riding comfort score rose by 40%, the average daily riding distance grew by 12%, and the fatigue after long rides decreased by 30%). (2) The AI-driven health management system can help users avoid excessive fatigue or injuries. (The average weekly riding distance increased by 25%, and the performance improved by 8%). (3) The MC events using AI algorithms have optimized the route and diversified the competition formats, attracting more participants. In previous studies, AI has brought benefits to the bicycle industry, yet there is scant research based on MC. However, this study reveals some challenges: (1) The application of AI algorithms in low-resource scenarios; (2) Issues related to user privacy protection; (3) Problems concerning the popularization of the technology. We suggest: (1) Verify the feasibility and effectiveness of AI technology in practical applications in MC through small-scale pilot experiments.

The findings indicate that most teachers believe AI cannot replace teachers but can play a supportive role in instruction. While some teachers actively use AI tools for lesson material design, concept reinforcement, and assessment processes, others have not yet integrated this technology into their practices. Although teachers generally maintain a positive attitude toward students’ use of AI tools, several concerns were raised regarding the lack of technological resources and the risk that students may become excessively dependent on readily accessible information. Some teachers emphasized that constant reliance on ready-made solutions may reduce students’ critical thinking skills and their ability to solve problems independently. Additionally, concerns were expressed that the widespread use of AI in education may negatively affect creative thinking, foster an emotionally detached generation, and raise ethical challenges.

In this paper, we address this gap by identifying key challenges in developing technical frameworks for AI systems’ regulation and proposing conceptual, methodological, and practical solutions to address these challenges. In this regard, we introduce the concept of AI’s operational qualification and propose the temporal self-replacement test, akin to certification tests for human operators, to examine the AI’s operational qualification. We propose measuring AI’s operational qualification across its operational properties critical for its regulatory fitness and introduce the operational qualification score as a pragmatic measure of AI’s regulatory fitness. In addition, we design and develop a Secure Framework for AI Regulation (SFAIR), a tool for automatic, recurrent, and secure examination of an AI’s operational qualification and attestation of its regulatory fitness, leveraging the proposed test and measure. Key strengths of SFAIR include its regulatory focus, flexibility in adapting to evolving regulatory requirements, and conformity to the secure-by-design principle. To achieve this, in addition to the aforementioned, we introduce a novel threat model for AI regulation frameworks. Considering the identified threats, we leverage randomization, masking, encryption-based schemes, and real-time monitoring to secure SFAIR operations. We also leverage AMD’s Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Encrypted State (SEV-ES) for enhanced system security. We validate the efficacy of the temporal self-replacement test and the practical utility of SFAIR by demonstrating its capability to support regulatory authorities in automated, recurrent, and secure AI qualification examination and attestation of its regulatory fitness using an open-source, high-risk AI system.

In colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer mortality world-wide, multimodal and vision-language models (VLMs) hold particular promise for enhancing the standardisation of histopathology reporting, the understanding of disease biology, and the discovery of novel prognostic indicators. Despite the availability of guidelines and reporting templates for essential prognostic indicators, variability remains in how key features such as TNM staging or tumour deposits are assessed and reported in routine clinical practice. AI-based tools have the potential to support refined extraction of established and extended features directly from whole-slide images. In parallel, recent studies have shown that DL models applied to pathology slides and associated AI-based biomarkers can outperform traditional histopathological prognostic indicators and uncover novel parameters, including tumour-adipocyte interactions, tumour-stroma ratio, and immune cell patterns at the invasive margin. Here, we review recent advances in both domains: AI-assisted standardisation of CRC pathology reporting and AI-driven identification of novel prognostic biomarkers. We highlight the need to refine and standardise CRC reporting practices and propose that a harmonised approach combining established pathology features with AI-derived prognostic indicators could refine risk assessment and improve outcomes for CRC patients. © 2026 The Author(s).

Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, including large language models (LLM), may complement expert judgment by systematically identifying trials with limited enrollment potential. The objective of this study was to compare investigator and LLM-based accrual estimates against actual accrual outcomes for gastrointestinal (GI) oncology trials. A secondary objective was to evaluate whether LLM-based accrual estimates could flag trials at risk of non-accrual.\n Methods:\n This study retrospectively examined GI oncology trials that closed before July 2024, prior to the adoption of the Triomics PRISM platform. For each trial, three measures were compared: investigator-derived accrual estimates generated before activation, actual patient accrual, and projections from OncoLLM (an LLM fine-tuned on institutional data and oncology guidelines). Accuracy was evaluated using two complementary approaches. First, the mean absolute error (MAE) was calculated between projected and actual accrual across trials. Second, a binary classification framework was applied using a pragmatic cutoff of ≤5 projected patients to flag trials at risk of non-accrual. Sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy were measured.\n Results:\n A total of 8 gastrointestinal oncology trials were included, with an average total accrual of 0.9 patients (SD 0.8). Investigator estimates were more accurate for continuous prediction (MAE 3.9 vs. 8.8 for OncoLLM). In the binary analysis, 4 of 8 trials (50%) closed with zero accrual. OncoLLM correctly classified 3 of the 4 trials as at risk of non-accrual (sensitivity 75%, specificity 100%). Across all 8 trials, OncoLLM correctly classified 7 (88%) as either at risk of non-accrual or not.\n Conclusions:\n While investigator estimates were closer to observed accrual when measured continuously, OncoLLM demonstrated value as a screening tool for identifying trials at risk of non-accrual. The model correctly classified 7 of 8 trials and flagged 3 of 4 non-accruing studies as at risk of non-accrual. LLM-based feasibility screening can be a complementary safeguard prior to trial activation, supporting more efficient resource allocation.\n \n \n Comparison of OncoLLM and physician estimates for trial accrual.\n \n \n \n \n Trial\n Physician Estimate\n OncoLLM Estimate\n Actual Accrual\n OncoLLM (At Risk of Non-Accrual)\n Actual No Accrual\n OncoLLM Correct\n \n \n \n \n 1\n 5\n 4\n 0\n Yes\n Yes\n Yes\n \n \n 2\n 5\n 6\n 1\n No\n No\n Yes\n \n \n 3\n 5\n 19\n 2\n No\n No\n Yes\n \n \n 4\n ≤5\n 0\n 0\n Yes\n Yes\n Yes\n \n \n 5\n 5\n 26\n 2\n No\n No\n Yes\n \n \n 6\n 4\n 3\n 0\n Yes\n Yes\n Yes\n \n \n 7\n 5\n 9\n 0\n No\n Yes\n No\n \n \n 8\n 5\n 10\n 2\n No\n No\n Yes\n \n \n \n \n"}, "authors": [{"id": "2364107602", "name": "Claire T.

Artificial intelligence can automate routine tasks (such as data entry and preparing returns), which can reduce errors and increase efficiency. Tax teams currently spend a significant amount of their time collecting and manipulating data, which artificial intelligence can do in a fraction of the time. Automation allows professionals to focus on higher value-added analytical and advisory tasks. Tax authorities actively use artificial intelligence for predictive analytics and network research to detect suspected tax evasion and fraud. Artificial intelligence helps analyse large amounts of financial data and identify suspicious patterns, making audits faster and more accurate. The introduction of a global minimum tax is an extremely complex and data-intensive process, for which multinational companies use artificial intelligence-based software to automate calculations and predict tax burdens. Companies that do not integrate artificial intelligence may find themselves at a significant competitive disadvantage.

This study investigates the impact of AI implementation on job stability in Indonesia, with job polarization and access to training examined as mediating variables. Using a quantitative research design, data were collected from 130 employees across various industries in Indonesia through a structured questionnaire measured on a five-point Likert scale. The data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling–Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS 3). The results reveal that AI implementation has a significant direct effect on job stability. Moreover, AI implementation significantly increases job polarization, which negatively affects job stability, while simultaneously enhancing access to training, which positively influences job stability. The mediation analysis demonstrates that job polarization and access to training partially mediate the relationship between AI implementation and job stability, with access to training exhibiting a stronger mediating effect. These findings suggest that the employment consequences of AI are not purely deterministic but are shaped by organizational strategies and human capital investments.

A comprehensive analysis of the score by John Williams, focusing on thematic and timbral elements, reveals this change in the interplay between the “Curiosity” theme and the “Bonding” theme. The usage of electronics along with ever-growing acoustic accompaniments further demonstrate Monica’s orga acceptance of the mecha David.

These failures are rarely due to technical limitations alone, but instead reflect deeper challenges related to organisational readiness, leadership, culture and behavioural change.\n \n \n \n This educational article presents a strategic transformation framework for the adoption of AI in healthcare, emphasizing that successful implementation requires simultaneous attention to both performance outcomes and organisational health.\n \n \n \n Drawing on the Beyond Performance 2.0 model, we propose a five‐frame approach—aspire, assess, architect, act and advance—to guide healthcare organisations across the full AI adoption journey.\n \n \n \n The framework begins with defining a clear and compelling aspiration for intelligent healthcare, aligned with organisational purpose and clinical priorities. It then emphasises systematic assessment of technical capabilities, governance structures, and underlying mindsets that may enable or impede change. The architect phase focuses on designing a balanced portfolio of AI initiatives alongside behavioural and cultural levers that foster understanding, role modelling, and reinforcement. Effective execution is supported through appropriate delivery models, strong governance, and continuous measurement of impact across initiatives, organisational health, performance, and enterprise value. Finally, the advance frame highlights the importance of institutionalising learning, ethical oversight and adaptive renewal to sustain long‐term transformation.\n \n \n \n By integrating strategy, leadership and culture with technological innovation, this framework offers actionable guidance for healthcare leaders seeking to move beyond isolated AI deployments towards resilient learning health systems. Such systems enable continuous improvement, responsible innovation and the delivery of care that is both data‐driven and deeply human‐centred.\n"}, "authors": [{"id": "2404166856", "name": "Mattias Wei Ren Kon"}, {"id": "2272990303", "name": "J.

However, its long-term impact remains underexplored. This study conducts a bibliometric and predictive analysis of -driven sports research over the past decade, identifying key contributors, emerging trends, and future directions through visualization techniques. Method: A systematic review was conducted on related sports research from 2014 to 2024 using the Web of Science Core Collection. Bibliometric tools Citespace and Vosviewer were employed to analyze publication trends, author networks, institutional collaborations, and keyword co-occurrences. Polynomial regression analysis was applied to forecast future research growth based on historical publication and citation trends. A total of 5,811 publications with 96,753 citations were identified. China, the United States, and the United Kingdom were the most productive countries, with China leading in volume but exhibiting lower citation impact. The Chinese Academy of Sciences, Stanford University, and the University of Oxford were the top research institutions. Keyword analysis revealed that \"machine learning,\" \"deep learning,\" and \"computer vision\" were the most studied topics, while emerging themes such as \"stress analysis,\" \"information processing,\" and \"pose estimation\" indicated shifts towards driven real-time monitoring and predictive analytics. Polynomial regression models predicted continued research growth, with publication trends following y = 354x\n ²\n + 1350x + 528 (r\n ²\n = 0.94) and citation growth modeled as y = 9680x\n ²\n + 24900x + 7850 (r\n ²\n = 0.99), suggesting sustained acceleration in AI applications within sports science. The integration of sports science has grown rapidly, with machine learning and computer vision playing a pivotal role in optimizing athletic performance, real-time feedback, and injury prevention. Predictive analytics and driven modeling can transform sports training by personalizing programs based on biomechanical and physiological data, enhancing both performance and injury resilience. However, disparities in AI adoption across regions and institutions highlight the need for greater international collaboration, particularly in developing regions where access to driven sports technologies is limited. Future research should refine -driven models for individualized training, integrate wearable sensor data for precision, and address ethical concerns. Additionally, policymakers and sports organizations should invest in AI-based training and health monitoring systems to bridge the gap between technology-rich and technology-limited regions. As it evolves, its role in sports science will expand, driving advancements in performance analysis, health monitoring, and strategic decision-making.\n"}, "authors": [{"id": "2372697918", "name": "Wanli Zang"}, {"id": "2405383070", "name": "Qiuxia Zhang"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Drawing from the Siva Purana (trans. Shastri, 1970) and the humanistic philosophies of Sri Aurobindo, Swami Vivekananda, and Deendayal Upadhyaya, the study examines how consciousness, compassion, and detachment - core tenets of Sivas persona - can serve as ethical anchors in the age of intelligent machines. Modern AI ethics emphasizes fairness, transparency, accountability, and human autonomy, yet often lacks a cohesive philosophical anthropology to define what it means to act, know, and value. By integrating Shivas vision of divine-human unity with Integral Humanism, the paper proposes a spiritually informed model of ethical intelligence rooted in awareness, universal compassion, and moral equilibrium. Through this framework, AI is re-conceptualized not merely as a technological tool but as a moral extension of human consciousness, capable of reflecting dharmic values that sustain collective welfare and ecological harmony. Shivas acts exemplify compassionate rationality that transcends rigid utilitarianism. This study argues that grounding AI development in Shivas humanism transforms algorithmic governance from procedural compliance into reflective moral action, ensuring that artificial systems uphold dignity, justice, and spiritual evolution. By aligning technological progress with the cosmic ethics of interconnectedness and balance, the paper concludes that Shivas humanism offers a transformative paradigm for reuniting intelligence and empathy in the digital age."}, "authors": [{"id": "2406997452", "name": "Nandini Bhartiya"}, {"id": "2406997479", "name": "Dr. Vivek Mehrotra"}], "fields_of_study": null}

This review synthesizes current research at the nexus of neuroscience and architecture, with a focus on how emerging virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are being utilized to understand and enhance human spatial experience. We systematically reviewed literature from 2015 to 2025, identifying key empirical studies and categorizing advances into three themes: core components of neuroarchitectural research; the use of physiological sensors (e.g., EEG, heart rate variability) and virtual reality to gather data on occupant responses; and the integration of neuroscience with AI-driven analysis. Findings indicate that built environment elements (e.g., geometry, curvature, lighting) influence brain activity in regions governing emotion, stress, and cognition. VR-based experiments combined with neuroimaging and physiological measures enable ecologically valid, fine-grained analysis of these effects, while AI techniques facilitate real-time emotion recognition and large-scale pattern discovery, bridging design features with occupant emotional responses. However, the current evidence base remains nascent, limited by small, homogeneous samples and fragmented data. We propose a four-domain framework (somatic, psychological, emotional, cognitive-“SPEC”) to guide future research. By consolidating methodological advances in VR experimentation, physiological sensing, and AI-based analytics, this review provides an integrative roadmap for replicable and scalable neuroarchitectural studies. Intensified interdisciplinary efforts leveraging AI and VR are needed to build robust, diverse datasets and develop neuro-informed design tools. Such progress will pave the way for evidence-based design practices that promote human well-being and cognitive health in built environments."}, "authors": [{"id": "2161136685", "name": "Avishag Shemesh"}, {"id": "2302005684", "name": "Gerry Leisman"}, {"id": "74254381", "name": "Y.

Quantitative analyses (multivariate analysis of covariance/analysis of covariance) demonstrated significant improvements across all learning outcomes for artificial intelligence groups compared with controls (\n p\n < .001), with the most pronounced effect sizes observed in the self-paced learning group (Cohen’s\n d\n = 2.71–16.43). Posttest indicated this group were substantially higher (academic writing:\n M\n = 7.09; vocabulary:\n M\n = 57.36; grammar:\n M\n = 48.21) compared with controls (\n M\n = 5.16, 29.72, 18.22, respectively), accounting for 68.3–98.0% of variance (partial η²). Thematic analysis of qualitative data (surveys, interviews) corroborated these findings, with 89% of participants in the self-paced group reporting enhanced autonomy and reduced cognitive load, in alignment with self-determination theory. Triangulation revealed robust associations between quantitative gains and qualitative themes of motivation, adaptability, and learner satisfaction. These results highlight the superiority of artificial intelligence-driven self-paced learning over static interventions, challenging the prevailing emphasis on content adaptation as the primary driver of proficiency. The study offers practical recommendations for integrating AI to optimize learner-centered language education while addressing technical and pedagogical challenges.\n"}, "authors": [{"id": "2403162323", "name": "Xirui Cai"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Among the tasks we will note the definition of the initial principle for constructing a working hypothesis and choosing an adequate methodology; verification of the applicability of the methodology of moral and religious neoinstitutionalism to the problem of artificial intelligence; determination of the factors enhancing Homo technicus; Identifying the risks of digitalization; identifying the greatest threat posed by artificial intelligence; formulating the basic principles for managing artificial intelligence by society (the \"Ten Commandments of Artificial Intelligence\").The creation of artificial intelligence offers new technical possibilities, but simultaneously increases risks, threatening the very essence of human society. Preserving the essence of humanity, as expressed in the Homo traditum model, requires a new ideology that limits the risks posed by technocracy. The study utilizes a comprehensive methodology of moral and religious neo-institutionalism. It is based on the principles of anthropologism, systemicity, balance, and morality. The theoretical significance of the study: introduction to the political science analysis of the terms Homo technicus, Homo traditum and the application of the methodology of moral and religious neoinstitutionalism to the problem of artificial intelligence. The book analyzes the factors that give rise to Homo technicus and the risks of the digital economy.

Drawing on the work of Andy Clarno, which demonstrates how Israel’s decreasing reliance on Palestinian labour made them inessential to exploitation, this article argues that Palestinians are valuable to Israel for another purpose: experimentation. For over fifty years, Palestinians have been rendered as test subjects for the development of surveillance and warfare technologies, in what Antony Lowenstein calls “the Palestine Laboratory.” AI introduces a dual paradigm where both Palestinian lives and deaths are turned into sites of data dispossession. This duality demands keeping Palestinians alive to generate constantly updating data for the lethal algorithmic systems that target them, while their deaths generate further data to refine and market those systems as “battle-tested.” The article describes this state as an algorithmic death-world, adapted from Achille Mbembe’s conception of necropolitics.

Applications include AI-enabled parenting support tools, mobile health interventions, digital therapeutics, remote monitoring systems, and algorithm-based platforms for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric assessment. While these technologies offer opportunities to enhance parental support, personalize care, and improve access to services, they also raise concerns related to ethics, equity, data privacy, and parent–child relationships. This narrative review offers an integrative overview of AI and digital technologies in family and parenting contexts, focusing on key domains such as AI-supported parenting interventions, digital health literacy, pediatric and perinatal care, neurodevelopmental and mental health assessment, digital media use, and family communication. Reported benefits, emerging risks, and unintended consequences are discussed with particular attention to parental roles, family-centered design, and implementation challenges. Overall, evidence suggests that AI-enabled tools are most effective when they are transparent, co-designed with parents and clinicians, and integrated into existing health and social care systems. Nonetheless, gaps remain regarding long-term outcomes, equitable access, ethical governance, and sustainable implementation. AI in digital parenting should therefore be viewed as a complementary resource that augments, rather than replaces, parental judgment and professional care."}, "authors": [{"id": "98794773", "name": "Ahu Pakdemirli"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Classical adjuvants, including alum, oil-in-water emulsions, liposomal formulations, and toll-like receptor agonists, function by fueling innate immunity, promoting antigen presentation, and modulating cytokine milieus. Yet, these compounds face persistent limitations such as reactogenicity, species-specific responses, manufacturing complexity, and regulatory barriers. Artificial intelligence (AI) and core subfields such as machine learning are revolutionizing vaccine design by enhancing antigen engineering, delivery system optimization, immunogenicity modeling, and\n in silico\n screening of novel immune potentiators. Here, I propose a speculative yet testable hypothesis: AI-driven design of potent antigens may progressively replace classical adjuvants. By embedding adjuvant-like functions directly into computationally designed antigens, AI-designed vaccines could replicate or excel the mechanistic roles of traditional adjuvants. This perspective critically explores current AI applications in vaccinology, discusses key challenges in the field, including biological complexity, data limitations, safety, and regulatory and ethical considerations, and outline the spectrum of adjuvant replacement—from augmentation to full substitution. Finally, a roadmap is proposed for transitioning toward AI-driven adjuvant surrogates. Notably, this work highlights a potential paradigm shift in vaccine design, suggesting that future advances will lead to a gradual, stepwise transition from the use of traditional adjuvants to computationally guided antigens and delivery platforms capable of outperforming classical adjuvant functions, thus creating a new vaccine era without exogenous chemical additives.\n"}, "authors": [{"id": "2319856506", "name": "Jose G.

The state, as the most powerful tool for organizing social processes, cannot but pay attention to innovations that permeate almost all spheres of society. Artificial intelligence provides the state with new tools, but it also requires government influence in order to ensure the security of society and regulate changing social relations. The purpose of the article is to conduct a theoretical analysis and determine the optimal model of government intervention in the formation of legal norms that regulate public relations arising in connection with the creation and application of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The conducted theoretical analysis allows us to conclude that the role of the state in regulating legal relations related to AI should be fundamentally new — not absolutely limiting but guiding and ensuring the development of these technologies. The State needs to create an adaptive legal environment based on relevant ethical and legal principles, which should be based on stimulating innovation and mandatory consideration of risks to society. State standards in the field of AI are of fundamental importance today, outlining the contours for future legal regulation through laws and regulations. There is an obvious need to introduce flexible regulatory models, such as experimental legal regimes, which will allow law to evolve synchronously with technological progress, ensuring legal certainty and protection of public and private interests."}, "authors": [{"id": "2248167812", "name": "A.

This paper introduces the AI Deployment Authorisation Score (ADAS), a machine-readable regulatory framework that evaluates AI systems across five legally and economically grounded dimensions: risk, alignment, externality, control, and auditability. ADAS produces a cryptographically verifiable deployment certificate that regulators, insurers, and infrastructure operators can consume as a license to operate, using public-key verification and transparency mechanisms adapted from secure software supply chain and certificate transparency systems. The paper presents the formal specification, decision logic, evidence model, and policy architecture of ADAS and demonstrates how it operationalizes the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act, United States critical infrastructure governance, and insurance underwriting requirements by compiling statutory and regulatory obligations into machine-executable deployment gates.

However, its acceptance by university students depends not only on technical or functional characteristics, but also on cognitive, contextual, and emotional factors. This study proposes and validates a model of acceptance of the use of AI devices (MIDA) in the university context. The model considers contextual variables such as anthropomorphism (AN), perceived value (PV) and perceived risk (PR). It also considers cognitive variables such as performance expectancy (PEX) and perceived effort expectancy (PEE). In addition, it considers emotional variables such as anxiety (ANX), stress (ST) and trust (TR). For its validation, data were collected from 517 university students and analysed using structural equations (CB-SEM). The results indicate that perceived value, anthropomorphism and perceived risk influence the willingness to accept the use of AI devices indirectly through performance expectancy and perceived effort. Likewise, performance expectancy significantly reduces anxiety and stress and increases trust, while effort expectancy increases both anxiety and stress. Trust is the main predictor of willingness to accept the use of AI devices, while stress has a significant negative effect on this willingness. These findings contribute to the literature on the acceptance of AI devices by highlighting the mediating role of emotions and offer practical implications for the design of AI devices aimed at improving their acceptance in educational contexts."}, "authors": [{"id": "2369763727", "name": "Luis Salazar"}, {"id": "2388115741", "name": "Luis Rivera"}], "fields_of_study": null}

In this Personal Account, I argue that dataset construction plays a central role in AI‐driven chemistry, not merely as a preparatory step but as a means of formalizing new chemical learning problems. I summarize recent efforts to build machine‐learning‐ready datasets in three domains: molecular property prediction, property‐conditioned molecular design, and reaction mechanism prediction. Experimentally measured optical property datasets were curated to explicitly incorporate environmental context, enabling models to learn structure–environment–property relationships that reflect real experimental conditions and to support inverse design of functional chromophores. For chemical reactivity, large‐scale mechanistic datasets were constructed through rule‐based imputation of elementary steps, transforming overall reactions into supervised learning problems for mechanism prediction. Limitations of sequence‐based reaction models motivated the development of FlowER, which represents reactions as electron redistribution processes using bond–electron matrices and enforces mass conservation by construction, allowing direct integration with quantum chemical validation. Together, these studies illustrate a unifying perspective in which datasets, representations, models, and downstream workflows are designed jointly, guided by chemical intuition. By framing dataset construction as an act of problem definition, this Account highlights how chemists can shape the scope and direction of artificial intelligence as a tool for chemical discovery."}, "authors": [{"id": "39583381", "name": "J.

Therefore, XAI methods must go beyond extracting learning patterns from ML models and present explanations of predictions in a human-centered, transparent, and interpretable manner.

It has touched almost every aspect of life. However, its use in the field of art and literature has raised several eyebrows amongst the critics and litterateurs alike. The main points of concern are related to ethics, plagiarism and the growth of dishonesty. With the help of AI, a sudden spurt of artists, authors and other literary people has sprung forth on the literary horizon. Now, anyone can become a writer, poet, artist or so, within no time. There is no need for talent and calibre. As a consequence, a large number of such fake talents in the field of art and literature are producing their AI-inspired works without making any substantial effort. Not only this, these pseudo-artists and writers are also making money. In the field of cinema, AI-generated scripts and music have become the order of the day. Another frightening aspect is the growth of vandalism. Some unscrupulous people have even tried to create caricatures and funny variants of many famous paintings by renowned painters. The disfiguration of the world-famous painting of Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci is a classic example. In short, the world of literature and arts is likely to experience a cataclysmic change in the near future if the proper checks and controls are not exercised by the lawmakers in this regard.

This prospectus synthesises current applications and outlines future research directions for integrating Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into marine ecosystem modelling while maintaining scientific rigour. I present a structured framework for integrating GenAI across eight interconnected components of the modelling cycle: model scoping, data gathering, conceptual framework development, model development, model execution, validation and calibration, reporting and stakeholder engagement. Through analysis of current applications and emerging research, I demonstrate how GenAI can automate routine tasks, democratise access to sophisticated modelling approaches, and improve model quality. Achieving success will require overcoming persistent challenges, including data limitations, institutional barriers and ethical concerns. I propose a research agenda addressing three streams: capability assessment to systematically evaluate GenAI's potential in marine ecosystem modelling; avenues for ensuring scientific integrity and reliability; and socio‐technical integration to address ethical and institutional challenges. While GenAI offers the potential to enhance modelling, a human‐centered approach is essential, where GenAI augments, rather than replaces, human expertise in model validation, interpretation of results and ensuring sustainable management outcomes.

AI technologies such as machine learning and big data analytics assist in policy planning and simulation, enabling policymakers to anticipate the social and economic consequences of decisions. AI-driven analytics can monitor public opinion, predict voter behavior, and enable micro-targeted campaigning, reshaping the dynamics of elections. Beyond domestic politics, AI models support crisis management and diplomacy by simulating scenarios to predict conflicts, assess risks, and inform negotiation strategies. Additionally, AI enhances cybersecurity and helps detect disinformation, protecting democratic processes against manipulation. However, the use of AI in politics raises significant ethical, social, and legal issues. Algorithmic decision-making may embed biases, reduce transparency, and concentrate power in the hands of those who control these systems. Concerns about data privacy, accountability, and equitable access further complicate AI’s integration into public life. Thus, while AI can make governance more efficient, responsive, and participatory, its deployment must be balanced with rigorous ethical standards, transparency measures, and regulatory oversight to preserve democratic integrity. Ultimately, AI’s rise represents a transformative shift in modern politics, offering both opportunities and challenges that society must carefully navigate."}, "authors": [{"id": "2406161205", "name": "Kamran Valizada"}], "fields_of_study": null}

This paper examines how generative AI systems challenge traditional human-centered models of artistic creation that have long shaped art theory and aesthetics. Drawing on interdisciplinary perspectives from art history, philosophy of art, and digital humanities, the study explores the shifting boundaries between human agency and machine participation in the creative process. It argues that artificial intelligence should not be understood merely as a technical instrument but as a co-creative agent that reconfigures established notions of originality, intentionality, and artistic labor.\nThrough a critical analysis of selected AI-generated artworks, digital exhibitions, and contemporary theoretical debates, the paper investigates how meaning and value are negotiated in works produced through human–machine collaboration. Particular attention is given to emerging questions of authorship, intellectual ownership, and the evolving role of the artist in an era of algorithmic creativity. The discussion further situates AI-driven art within broader cultural and ethical frameworks, addressing concerns related to transparency, algorithmic bias, and the commodification of creativity in digital economies.\nBy proposing a revised conceptual framework for understanding creativity in the age of artificial intelligence, this study contributes to ongoing debates in contemporary aesthetics and digital art studies. The findings suggest that rather than diminishing human creativity, AI expands the creative field by enabling new aesthetic practices, critical interpretations, and modes of artistic engagement. This research offers valuable insights for scholars in the arts and humanities and provides a foundation for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the cultural implications of artificial intelligence in artistic production."}, "authors": [{"id": "2405022601", "name": "Dr. Kalpna Singh"}, {"id": "2403895105", "name": "Anjali"}], "fields_of_study": null}

As AI technologies advance rapidly, they present a combination of significant opportunities and complex challenges. In this study, we examine the role of AI in higher education, highlighting both its positive and negative impacts, as well as current policy gaps and issues arising from its deployment. The literature on the topic was reviewed to determine how AI decisively impacts teaching and learning, the role of AI in assessments and academic integrity, as well as ethics, psychological considerations, and institutional governance from an ethical and psychological perspective. Technologies used in new areas, such as adaptive AI-based systems, intelligent tutoring platforms, and generative AI tools, create new opportunities for accessibility and personalization of learning experiences, thereby increasing student motivation. Skills development, such as writing and linguistic skills, can enhance AI capabilities. Additionally, it facilitates assessment methods by improving processes, providing immediate feedback, and adjusting evaluations accordingly. However, when students rely heavily on AI for their assessment tasks, it raises questions about academic integrity, cognitive offloading, and the limits of skills acquisition. While progress has been made, numerous open questions remain regarding the detection of AI-generated content, including the incorporation of fake narratives into generative AI tools, biases, privacy concerns, and the impact of the technology on our environment. Policies on AI governance have not yet matured in many higher education institutions; an integrated approach will be required from a broader perspective, including training faculty and utilizing institutional resources to benefit from AI while mitigating associated risks. To synthesize recent research on artificial intelligence in higher education, this study employs a narrative review approach. Unlike existing reviews that focus primarily on the integrated analysis of AI’s pedagogical, assessment, ethical, psychological, and institutional governance implications, this multidimensional perspective provides a consolidated framework to support responsible AI use across higher education systems."}, "authors": [{"id": "2182505627", "name": "Sharifa AlBlooshi"}], "fields_of_study": null}

The main attention is paid to the problem of correlation between efficiency and transparency of intellectual systems. The study considers the phenomenon of decreasing explainability of solutions when the complexity of artificial intelligence systems increases. The author analyzes this phenomenon not as a technological limitation, but as a fundamental property of complex cognitive systems. The study is based on a comparative analysis of decision-making processes in natural and artificial intelligence, which makes it possible to identify common regularities of their functioning. Special attention is paid to the study of parallels between natural cognitive processes and the work of modern neural networks. Current problems of verification and validation of intelligent systems under conditions of their increasing complexity are considered. The influence of digital transformation on the development of new approaches to assessing the reliability of artificial intelligence systems is studied. A verification system based on four key criteria has been developed: stability of results, correctness of behavior in boundary conditions, robustness of solutions and the possibility of external validation. The existence of a fundamental relationship between the efficiency of intellectual systems and the inevitable decrease in their explainability is proved. The necessity of transition from traditional verification methods to more flexible approaches that take into account the specificity of complex cognitive systems is substantiated. The proposed methodology opens new perspectives for development and implementation of artificial intelligence systems in the conditions of digital transformation of society. The study makes a significant contribution to the development of the philosophy of artificial intelligence and offers practical solutions for assessing the reliability of intelligent systems.

Major advancements in diabetes care began with the discovery of insulin in 1921, transforming\nType 1 Diabetes from a fatal disease to a manageable condition. However, conventional insulin therapy still struggles to\nmimic precise physiological glucose–insulin regulation. To overcome this limitation, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has\nemerged as a powerful tool in personalized insulin therapy, enabling real-time, data-driven treatment adjustments. Smart\nInsulin Pumps, or Artificial Pancreas Systems, utilize CGM feedback combined with AI algorithms for automated insulin\ndelivery, significantly improving glycemic control and reducing hypoglycemia compared to traditional methods.\nContinuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) integrated with AI enhances glucose trend prediction and enables closed-loop\n\ntherapy for both Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes patients. AI-based mobile health applications further support self-\nmanagement by offering real-time alerts, behavioral guidance, and remote clinician monitoring. Predictive analytics now\n\nallow anticipation of hypo/hyperglycemia up to 120 minutes in advance, enabling personalized dose titration and reducing\nclinical inertia. Additionally, AI-driven Clinical Decision Support Systems (AI-CDSS) improve inpatient and outpatient\ninsulin therapy safety by minimizing dosing errors and standardizing care workflows.

This study examines how AI-driven technologies can enhance knowledge preservation and strengthen strategic decision-making frameworks within Nigeria’s security architecture. Guided by the Knowledge Management Theory and Information Warfare Theory, the research adopts a qualitative approach, drawing on content analysis of policy documents, scholarly publications, and institutional reports from the Nigerian Defence Academy, NITDA, and global AI frameworks. Findings reveal that while AI presents immense opportunities for improving intelligence analysis, data preservation, and evidence-based policy formulation, Nigeria faces critical challenges, including poor digital infrastructure, limited AI literacy, and weak policy coordination. The study underscores the urgent need for a National AI and Knowledge Preservation Policy to safeguard institutional memory, promote data sovereignty, and strengthen national resilience against emerging cyber and information threats.

Health AI practitioners should prioritize successful adaptation into clinical practice in order to provide meaningful benefits to patients, but translation usually requires collaboration with industry. We discuss three features of AI studies that hamper the integration of AI into clinical practice from the perspective of researchers and clinicians. These include lack of clinically relevant metrics, lack of clinical trials and longitudinal studies to validate results, and lack of patient and physician involvement in the development process. For partnerships between industry and health research to be sustainable, a balance must be established between patient and industry benefit. We propose three approaches for addressing this gap: improved transparency and explainability of AI models, fostering relationships with industry partners that have a reputation for centering patient benefit in their practices, and prioritization of overall healthcare benefits. With these priorities, we can sooner realize meaningful AI technologies used by clinicians where mutually beneficial impacts for patients, healthcare providers, and industry can be realized."}, "authors": [{"id": "2368582270", "name": "Rina Khan"}, {"id": "2403272739", "name": "Annabelle Sauve"}, {"id": "2403284323", "name": "Imaan Bayoumi"}, {"id": "2403273970", "name": "Amber L.

We introduce three aligned taxonomies for trust dimensions (e.g., fairness, transparency, accountability, inclusiveness, ethical alignment), risk categories (e.g., model, data, legal, operational, societal, cognitive, emergent, third‐party) and security controls (e.g., access management, infrastructure hardening, runtime enforcement, privacy‐enhancing techniques). Building on these, we develop a detailed toxicity taxonomy for generative AI—covering hate, violence, self‐harm, misinformation, bias, jailbreak attacks, multimodal harms, and more—each mapped to specific TRiSM safeguards. Through cross‐domain case studies in finance, healthcare, autonomous vehicles, public sector, cybersecurity, and beyond, we illustrate practical integration patterns and governance workflows. We also identify key adoption challenges—fragmented tooling, late‐stage governance, scalability constraints, evolving threats and regulations—and chart a forward‐looking roadmap toward adaptive, AI‐driven policy engines, causal explainability, privacy‐by‐design pipelines, continuous real‐time assurance, federated governance, quantum‐safe architectures, and sustainable “green AI” practices.

Using a quasi-experimental design, 70 Omani English language learners with an intermediate English proficiency level were assigned to a control group (which received general corrective feedback from the teacher) and an experimental group (which received detailed feedback from the Copilot AI and extra instructions form the teacher after Copilot AI), with 35 students in each group. Two comparison-contrast writing tasks were used as pretests and posttests and scored by two markers on Task Achievement, Organisation, Grammar and Lexicon. Although the initial findings revealed improvements in writing skills in both control and experimental groups, the detailed analysis of the posttest indicated that the experimental group performed significantly better than the control group in developing writing skills. In addition, the significant size effects of both tests revealed that both groups started with similar knowledge of writing skills in the pretest, but experimental group’s performance showed larger effect sizes which reveal higher performance in written tasks. The results of the study are insightful for teachers, learners and institutions."}, "authors": [{"id": "2229488747", "name": "Abdullah Al Maqbali"}, {"id": "2403400548", "name": "Salah Al-Hanshi"}, {"id": "2292277245", "name": "Ali Al Ghaithi"}, {"id": "114737367", "name": "Behnam Behforouz"}], "fields_of_study": null}

This research employed a quantitative approach to develop an overall conceptual model that encompasses both the technical and behavioral aspects of intelligent system adoption. The target population consisted of customs officers, border security personnel, and IT personnel responsible for customs clearance and trade facilitation in Jordan. The structured questionnaires were administered to the respondents to measure their perceptions of system effectiveness, satisfaction, performance outcomes, and evasion behavior and yielded a total of 358 valid responses. The research was conducted with proper statistical analysis, and the statistical techniques employed included primary data collected via SPSS Version 29 and advanced modeling using Structural Equation Modeling-Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS) through the use of SmartPLS 4.0. The results indicated that the measurement model proved to be both valid and reliable, with Cronbach's alpha values exceeding 0.82 and AVE values above 0.50, indicating good internal consistency and convergent validity. Moreover, the structural model achieved good explanatory power, with R² values of 59% for Customs Evasion, 43% for User Satisfaction, and 100% for Digital Performance Indicators. These findings underscore the significance of user satisfaction as a key outcome of system effectiveness and a valuable tool for enhancing performance and deterrence. More specifically, the results shown how Intelligent System Effectiveness presents a positive and significant impact on User Satisfaction (β = 0.656, p < 0.001), which in turn has a high positive effect on both Digital Performance Indicators (β = 1.000, p < 0.001) and Customs Evasion reduction (β = 0.770, p < 0.001). The mediation analysis also confirmed that User Satisfaction fully mediates the relationship between system effectiveness and performance outcome, as well as between system effectiveness and evasion reduction. This research contributes to theory and practice by demystifying the design and implementation of AI-driven customs systems. It illustrates the importance of valuing both technical system quality and user-centric values in achieving and maintaining optimal performance in the digital space, as well as conformance with the law."}, "authors": [{"id": "2345486156", "name": "A.

Access to high-quality board preparation resources is uneven and often cost-prohibitive, disproportionately affecting students from underrepresented or financially disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\n\nAPPROACH\nAn AI-driven system to generate USMLE-style practice questions aligned with NBME item-writing guidelines using a Large Language Model (LLM) enhanced with retrieval augmented generation (RAG), chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting, and JSON schema validation was developed and piloted at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine between November and December 2023. Five lectures from a preclinical hematology course were selected, and 565 questions were generated for 177 first-year medical students. A human-in-the-loop process, led by a faculty course director, ensured content validity and adherence to educational standards. Validated questions were deployed via a mobile app, allowing students to practice, receive performance feedback, and access an AI tutor.\n\n\nOUTCOMES\nOf the 565 questions, 490 (87%) were deemed accurate and NBME-compliant. Eighty students used the question bank, completing up to 220 questions each. Although not statistically significant, increased use trended toward improved performance on related exam questions. Qualitative feedback highlighted enthusiasm for AI-assisted study tools, with calls for broader content coverage.\n\n\nNEXT STEPS\nThis pilot demonstrates that LLMs can generate high-quality, guideline-aligned practice questions. To improve scalability and reduce faculty workload, future iterations will incorporate AI-based review agents for pre-screening content. The platform is intended to be expanded to additional courses, training phases, and health professions. Ongoing refinement will focus on improving content specificity and maintaining accuracy, especially in advanced and subspecialty education."}, "authors": [{"id": "2375794397", "name": "Andrew Zahn"}, {"id": "2267182282", "name": "Seth Overla"}, {"id": "2406791047", "name": "D.

This empirical research is based on the practical experience of the world’s top 20 countries in AI development in 2020 and 2024, as reflected in the socio-economic statistics of these nations. As a result, the authors developed an econometric model of AI’s impact on the digital society in Russia and other leading AI countries. Drawing on this model, the primary conclusion is that the key specific conditions for the diffusion of AI, which, in turn, shape the development of a digital society in Russia, are the innovativeness of AI technologies, social adaptation to AI, and the accessibility and reliability of AI infrastructure. The scientific novelty and theoretical contribution of this research lie in clarifying the social consequences of modernizing economic systems based on AI. The comparative and trend analysis reveals that Russia’s AI exhibits high global competitiveness (with Russia ranking among the world leaders in overall terms and specific conditions for AI diffusion during 2020–2024), as well as favorable trends in AI (five-year trends indicating improvements in overall and specific conditions for AI diffusion), which encourage further development of the digital society in Russia. The research outlines the prospects for developing a digital society in Russia under the influence of AI through two alternative scenarios – one envisioning the evolution of the digital society in Russia and the other suggesting enhanced inclusiveness, thus highlighting the alternative nature of these digital society characteristics."}, "authors": [{"id": "2404748660", "name": "Konstantin Vodenko"}, {"id": "2404752936", "name": "Platon A.

However, banks and financial institutions introduce new tactics to reduce fraud incidents daily. Minchin (2025) also explains that UK banks were able to reimburse 98% of victims caught up in fraud incidents where criminals had gained access to their accounts or cards and had stolen money. Whereas, through authorized push payments methods, or APP for short, which ideally means that the victims were on the phone with criminals who had tricked then into sending them money through bank transfers. Banks were able to identify the genuineness of these cases as was able to return money of approximately 62% of such victims. On this paper, fraud and scams pertaining to credit cards are explained and how artificial intelligence and machine learning models, and even generative AI, can be used to identify and prevent such fraudulent activities are discussed."}, "authors": [{"id": "2405750673", "name": "Minul Mindula Subasinghe"}], "fields_of_study": null}

At initial stages, AI innovation significantly boosts competitiveness; however, beyond a critical threshold, the marginal benefits diminish and can become negative. Substantive innovation, which requires higher capital investment, is relatively less efficient in improving competitiveness compared with strategic innovation. Mechanism analysis shows that AI innovation affects enterprise competitiveness through three inverted U-shaped channels: enhancing innovation efficiency, optimizing labor structure and improving governance structure. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the issuance of the “Notice on the New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan” facilitates faster attainment and maintenance of competitive advantage. Enterprises in high AI innovation industries, with higher risk-taking capacity and lower agency costs, benefit more from AI innovation. Further moderation analysis identifies that regional innovation levels, marketization indices, financing constraints and average managerial age significantly influence the AI innovation–competitiveness relationship.\n \n \n \n The findings guide enterprises in digital transformation and AI strategy, and inform AI patent policy.\n \n \n \n This study integrates enterprise-level AI innovation with competitiveness, revealing nonlinear effects, multiple mediating channels and the conditional role of policy and firm characteristics.\n"}, "authors": [{"id": "2112819754", "name": "Yali Chang"}, {"id": "2404971501", "name": "Qiulan Liu"}, {"id": "2404749095", "name": "Yue Lyu"}, {"id": "2407646528", "name": "Chengying He"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Recent work shows that low (vs. high)-similarity fillers beyond MTD improve discriminability. We tested lineups constructed with differing suspect-filler (SF) similarity levels beyond MTD (low, moderate, high) against MTD only, varying exposure duration, culprit race, and innocent suspect-culprit resemblance (guilty-innocent [GI] similarity).\n\n\nHYPOTHESES\nWe expected the highest discriminability for low-SF similarity lineups, moderate next, MTD-only lower, and high lowest-alongside higher discriminability for long (cf. short) exposures, same-race (cf. cross-race) culprits, and low GI similarity (cf. high). We expected high-SF similarity to better protect high GI similarity innocents and low F-similarity to aid culprit identifications regardless of GI similarity. We also anticipated stronger benefits of low-SF similarity lineups for cross-race culprits and shorter exposures.\n\n\nMETHOD\nAll lineups, except MTD only, were constructed using an artificial intelligence-driven, objective, and reproducible measure and varied by SF similarity. Participants (N = 2,644) recruited via Prolific watched four short or long videos (half with White, half with African American culprits), completed a distractor task, and made lineup identifications (culprit-present or culprit-absent) with confidence ratings.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth low- and high-SF similarity lineups produced higher discriminability than MTD-only lineups. While low-SF similarity lineups enhanced guilty suspect detection, high-SF similarity lineups better protected innocent suspects. Furthermore, low-SF similarity lineups yielded the best identification accuracy, and high-SF similarity lineups yielded the best diagnosticity ratio. No interactions emerged.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUsing match-to-suspect beyond MTD-especially at the highest or lowest SF similarity-improves lineup performance regardless of factors outside the justice system's control.

Significance Understanding microbial growth and morphology at the single-cell level is essential for studying microbial physiology, providing valuable insights for research and biotechnology. However, existing workflows often rely on manual cell annotation, which limits efficiency and scalability. Therefore, developing an automated workflow for quantitative analysis of cell growth and morphology is highly desirable. Aim We aim to develop an AI-driven analysis system that efficiently segments and indexes microbial cells, and quantitatively analyzes individual cellular features without requiring expensive annotations, for automated monitoring of cell counts and morphological characteristics. Approach The automated system consists of four modular components: denoising, zero-shot segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM), structured post-processing, and a quantitative feature extraction. To evaluate the effectiveness of each component, we conducted ablation experiments and systematically studied their impact on the overall system performance. Results Denoising and post-processing improved segmentation accuracy by 12.10% and 2.30%, respectively. Among the evaluated SAM variants, the SAM-H model achieved the best performance, with an average error rate of only 3.0% across 1162 manually annotated Escherichia coli cells. Using the optimized SAM-H pipeline, the system efficiently extracted morphometric and intensity features from Escherichia coli cells and nuclei of the yeast and cancer cell lines. Conclusions This framework automates quantitative analysis of microbial cells in high-resolution microscopy images. It will enable advanced research on microbial adaptations, with the potential to accelerate studies of extremophiles under harsh environments."}, "authors": [{"id": null, "name": "Shuang Zhang"}, {"id": "2358455813", "name": "Carleton Coffin"}, {"id": "2240191045", "name": "Karyn L.

There is limited information regarding the views of patients on AI in healthcare. The aim of our study was to assess the views of patients on the use of AI in healthcare with an on-site questionnaire. Patients in our tertiary hospital with a diagnostic imaging appointment were invited to complete a paper-based questionnaire between December 2022 and October 2023. We asked about socio-demographic data, experience, knowledge, and their opinion on the use of AI in healthcare, focusing on the fields (1) diagnostics, (2) therapy, and (3) triage. Out of a total of 198 patients (mean age 49.41 ± 17.6 years, 99 female), 91.5% stated that they expected benefits from the implementation of AI in healthcare, although 73.4% rated their knowledge of AI as moderate to none. The majority of patients were in favour of using AI in diagnostics (87.2%) and therapy (73.1%), while only 28.2% approved its use in patient triage. 84.0% wanted to be informed about the use of AI in at least one of the mentioned areas. Participants with higher education, higher self-assessed knowledge of AI and personal experience with AI showed greater approval for AI in healthcare. Our interviewed patients have a rather open attitude towards AI in healthcare, with differentiated views depending on the topic; patients are in favour of the use of AI, especially in diagnostics and to a lesser extent also for therapy support, but they reject its use for triage. Overall, the results emphasise the need for widespread efforts to address patient concerns about AI in healthcare, including enhancing understanding and acceptance while protecting marginalised groups. This will help clinical radiology to adopt AI more effectively. There is limited information on patients’ views of AI in healthcare, often focused on specific groups, limiting generalizability. Patients are open to AI in healthcare, supporting its use in diagnostics and therapy, but rejecting its use for triage.

Applying information design methods from Strack and Yang (2024), this paper provides decision problem agnostic conditions under which separation training preference free and applying preferences ex post is optimal. Unlike prior work that requires specifying downstream objectives, the welfare results here apply uniformly across decision problems. The key primitive is a diminishing-value-of-information condition: relative to a fixed (normalised) preference-free loss, preference embedding makes informativeness less valuable at the margin, inducing a mean-preserving contraction of learned posteriors. Because the value of information is convex in beliefs, preference-free training weakly dominates for any expected utility decision problem. This provides theoretical foundations for modular AI pipelines that learn calibrated probabilities and implement asymmetric costs through downstream decision rules. However, separation requires users to implement optimal decision rules. When cognitive constraints bind, as documented in human AI decision-making, preference embedding can dominate by automating threshold computation. These results provide design guidance: preserve optionality through post-processing when objectives may shift; embed preferences when decision-stage frictions dominate."}, "authors": [{"id": "2362107267", "name": "Joshua S.

Many fresh graduates face a skills mismatch, as traditional curricula lag behind industry needs, requiring not only technical knowledge but also critical thinking, problem-solving, and adaptability. This study aims to analyze the effects of AI Knowledge and Job Market Awareness on Fresh Graduates’ Quality with Employability Skills as a mediating variable. This research adopts a quantitative approach using a survey method. Data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares–Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to examine the relationships among the research variables. This study finds that AI Knowledge and Job Market Awareness positively and significantly influence Employability Skills and Fresh Graduates’ Quality. Employability Skills have a direct effect on graduate quality and also mediate the effects of AI Knowledge and Job Market Awareness, indicating that skill development is the main pathway through which technological understanding and labor market awareness enhance graduates’ work readiness and overall quality. Based on the findings, students are encouraged to strengthen their critical evaluation skills when using AI tools, develop a more realistic understanding of job market conditions, enhance their ability to assess the accuracy and relevance of digital information, and consistently demonstrate ethical and responsible behavior in academic and professional activities. Future research is recommended to involve broader samples and additional variables to improve generalizability and to further examine factors influencing fresh graduates’ quality in AI-driven labor markets."}, "authors": [{"id": "2408032378", "name": "Feliana Handayani"}, {"id": "2319517348", "name": "Made Ratih Nurmalasari"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Penggunaan AI dalam transaksi dagang semakin meluas dan kompleks, namun pengaturannya dalam sistem hukum nasional masih belum memadai. Untuk menjawab persoalan tersebut, penelitian ini menggunakan metode yuridis normatif dengan pendekatan konseptual dan komparatif. Data dikumpulkan melalui studi kepustakaan terhadap bahan hukum primer seperti Kitab Undang-Undang Hukum Dagang, Kitab Undang-Undang Hukum Perdata, Undang-Undang Informasi dan Transaksi Elektronik (UU No. 11 Tahun 2008), Undang-Undang Perlindungan Konsumen (UU No. 8 Tahun 1999), serta Peraturan Pemerintah No. 71 Tahun 2019 tentang Penyelenggaraan Sistem dan Transaksi Elektronik, disertai bahan hukum sekunder yang relevan. Analisis dilakukan secara kualitatif untuk menafsirkan norma yang berlaku dan mengidentifikasi kekosongan maupun kelemahan regulasi dalam konteks perdagangan digital berbasis Artificial Intelligence. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa hukum dagang Indonesia belum mengatur secara eksplisit kedudukan, kapasitas hukum, dan tanggung jawab sistem kecerdasan buatan dalam aktivitas dagang, sehingga menimbulkan potensi ketidakpastian dan sengketa bagi para pelaku usaha maupun konsumen. Temuan ini menegaskan perlunya reformasi hukum yang bersifat adaptif dan prospektif melalui pembentukan kerangka hukum komprehensif yang mampu mengakomodasi karakteristik teknologi digital sekaligus memberikan perlindungan hukum, kepastian, serta keadilan dalam praktik perdagangan modern."}, "authors": [{"id": "2406594051", "name": "Fransesko Mahesa Vagansa"}, {"id": "2406595544", "name": "Angelina Pancawati"}, {"id": "2406595103", "name": "Dita Fadzillaturrachman"}, {"id": "2406513125", "name": "Bagas Wisnu Nugroho"}], "fields_of_study": null}

The gold standard for AVC quantification is computed tomography (CT) aortic valve Agatston calcium score (AVCS).\n \n \n \n To quantify AVC in echocardiography (TTE) using deep learning models.\n \n \n \n 439 TTE and their corresponding CT AVCS from 234 patients included in the BICATOR [1] and a local study were partitioned at patient level into 165 TTEs (996 parasternal long and short axis and 3-chamber videos, from 7 centres) for training and cross-validation, and 274 (1488 videos, 9 centres) for testing, maintaining 89 studies (434 videos) from two centres exclusive for testing. Additionally, an external dataset, SALTIRE2 [2] comprising 255 TTEs (2159 videos) from 154 patients with mild or moderate AS was used to test model performance on independent data.\n Models were fine-tuned from PanEcho [3], with task-specific heads for binary classification and AVCS quantification. Five-fold cross-validation on training produced five models per task. After outlier removal, their averaged predictions were compared to reference CT AVCS.\n \n \n \n In the training cohort, median age was 53 [44; 72] years, with 32 (29%) females while 65 (59%) patients had a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). AVC was absent in 37 (33%) patients, and those with calcification had a median AVCS of 1371 [687; 3112] AU. The median TTE to CT was 40 [7; 134] days. The testing cohort had a median age of 67 [48; 74] years and included 61 (22%) females and 126 (46%) patients with a BAV. AVC was present in 215 (79%) patients with a median AVCS of 1103 [530; 2067] AU. The cohort TTE-CT interval was 0 [0; 32] days.\n The model achieved excellent accuracy in distinguishing patients with and without AVC in the internal cross-validation (AUROC of 0.980 [0.961-0.993], figure 1), testing set (0.974 [0.962-0.983]) and in the external multicentre validation (0.983 [0.972-0.992]). AVCS quantification model performed well in cross-validation (R=0.89; error: 116 [0-551] AU) and remained robust in the testing set (R=0.64; error: 308 [3-977] AU) and external multicentre validation (R=0.47; error: 669 [184-1191] AU).\n Baseline AVCS predictions were significantly correlated with future progression of AS severity, as measured by changes in AV maximum velocity, pressure gradient, and CT AVCS (all p<0.001). Baseline AVCS by TTE demonstrated excellent discrimination for future valve replacement (AVR), either when predictions were stratified by terciles and after selecting sex-specific optimal thresholds (Youden index, 1343 AU for males and 1052 for females) (p<0.001, Fine and Gray model with all-cause mortality as competing risk) (figure 2).\n \n \n \n A deep learning model estimates AVCS from TTE with strong performance and generalizability. AVCS by TTE predicts aortic stenosis progression and need for valve replacement, supporting its potential for risk assessment.Fig 1.AUROC AVCS>0 by Echocardiography  Fig 2.Cumulative incidence of AVR.\n"}, "authors": [{"id": "2313865487", "name": "P.

These challenges include evaluation criteria being too one-dimensional, over-emphasis on quantitative research, inadequate monitoring and feedback. This paper develops the author’s previous research on teacher performance evaluation reforms at the undergraduate level in Anhui Province. This paper attempts to identify ways AI can be used in teacher performance evaluation to support and facilitate the improvement of strategic, evaluative, and developmental alignment and performance evaluation reforms.\nMethodology/approach: The study relies on a mixed-methods approach rooted in the theories of strategic human resource management. First, a systematic review of the literature, both domestic and global, on teacher performance evaluations, AI in educational management, and strategic human resource management. Second, an AI performance evaluation model is created by adapting an existing strategy-oriented performance evaluation framework for undergraduate educators in Anhui Province and incorporating data analytics, intelligent performance evaluation, and multi-source performance evaluation systems. The evaluation of the proposed model relies on empirical data collected using teacher questionnaires from some undergraduate institutions in Anhui Province, utilizing various statistical techniques such as reliability and validity analyses and structural equation modeling.\nOriginality/Relevance: Use of smart data analysis and multi-faceted assessment tools mitigate the overemphasis on research output metrics and encourage a more holistic and equitable recognition of teaching, research, and community service contributions. Employees experience greater feelings of equity and motivation to perform under the AI evaluative structure. This research examines the evaluation of university faculty using artificial intelligence as a strategic resource management tool in the higher education system. The study responds to a national policy requirement to eliminate the ‘five-only’ framework of evaluation and the current evaluations in undergraduate colleges in Anhui Province, which are described as evaluative, disappointing to teachers, and lacking feedback. Teacher evaluation with AI shows promise in improving objectivity, accuracy, and a developmental focus in evaluation.\n \nKey findings: The findings indicate that AI can close the gap between the university’s strategic goals and the individual aims of the faculty, enhance the accuracy and justifiability of evaluation criteria, and strengthen evaluation criteria and systems for feedback and sustained improvement.\n \nTheoretical/methodological contributions: The integration of artificial intelligence and the theories of strategic human resource management and performance evaluation gives rise to a new theory in the management of higher education. The new theory is the foundation of the construction of a systematic AI evaluative structure, which is a valuable and unique contribution of this work. The systematic AI evaluative structure, which is based on the principles of goal management, competence-driven evaluative criteria, and intelligent feedback systems, is an empirically proven model for transformative reform of the evaluative frameworks of teacher performance in higher education, especially in institutions in Anhui Province."}, "authors": [{"id": "2406582586", "name": "Song Jiao"}, {"id": "13843372", "name": "Sururi Sururi"}, {"id": "2406580549", "name": "Aan Komariah"}, {"id": "66414798", "name": "T.

Standard weight-based dosing may result in either subtherapeutic exposure or toxicity. Machine learning (ML) models can capture complex relationships among clinical variables and support individualized therapy. Methods We analyzed clinical and pharmacokinetic data from 20 pediatric patients enrolled in the PUERI study (January 2020–November 2021, ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda, Milan, Italy). Eight ML models-including linear regression (LR), ridge regression (RR), lasso regression (LaR), Huber regression (HR), random forest (RF), XGBoost, LightGBM, and a neural network (MLP)-were trained to predict ceftaroline doses that would achieve plasma concentrations close to the therapeutic target of 10 mg/L. Model performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and the coefficient of determination (R2). To ensure interpretability, we applied local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) to identify the most influential predictors of dose. Results MLP (MAE 1.53 mg, R2 0.94) and XGBoost (MAE 2.04 mg, R2 0.89) outperformed linear models. Predicted doses were more frequently aligned with therapeutic concentrations than those clinically administered. Model-based simulated concentrations fell within the therapeutic range in approximately 85% of cases, and the best ML models showed over 90% patient-level clinical. RF, LightGBM and XGBoost achieved the highest clinical alignment, with 94.2, 92.4 and 91.5% of patients reaching therapeutic levels. Renal function markers, such as serum creatinine and azotemia, together with anthropometric parameters including weight, height, and body mass index, were consistently the most influential features. Conclusion Advanced ML models can optimize ceftaroline dosing in pediatric patients and outperform traditional dosing strategies. Combining predictive accuracy with interpretability (via LIME) supports clinical trust and may enhance precision antibiotic therapy while reducing the risks of antimicrobial resistance and toxicity."}, "authors": [{"id": "2277215513", "name": "Maria Frasca"}, {"id": "2112802466", "name": "Gianluca Gazzaniga"}, {"id": "2355891841", "name": "Agnese Graziosi"}, {"id": "2313853916", "name": "Valentina De Nicolò"}, {"id": "2169391728", "name": "Costantino De Giacomo"}, {"id": "2238651456", "name": "S.

Specific Background: In algorithm and programming domains, Generative AI models frequently assign Higher Order Thinking Skills and Lower Order Thinking Skills labels automatically, creating potential discrepancies with Bloom’s Taxonomy classifications. Knowledge Gap: Empirical evidence validating the reliability of AI-generated cognitive labels and comparing statistical and transformer-based classification methods on small, domain-specific Indonesian datasets remains limited. Aims: This study aims to audit the reliability of cognitive labels generated by the Gemini model through expert validation and to compare TF-IDF–SVM and IndoBERT–SVM classifiers under class-imbalanced conditions. Results: Expert validation revealed substantial mislabeling, with a claimed balanced dataset becoming skewed toward LOTS. Classification experiments using five-fold cross-validation showed that TF-IDF–SVM achieved a slightly higher macro F1-score than IndoBERT–SVM. Novelty: The study demonstrates that simple lexical representations with stemming can outperform transformer-based embeddings when data are limited and domain-specific. Implications: These findings emphasize the necessity of human validation in AI-generated assessments and support the use of lightweight statistical text classification for automated cognitive level evaluation in constrained educational contexts.\nHighlights\n• Generative AI cognitive labels showed substantial inconsistency after expert validation• Lexical feature representation yielded higher macro-level classification balance• Human-in-the-loop validation remained essential for programming assessment datasets\nKeywords\nHOTS; LOTS; Generative AI; Text Classification; TF-IDF"}, "authors": [{"id": "2404794119", "name": "Raissa Araminta Khairunnisa"}, {"id": "35861074", "name": "U.

To move toward more general intelligence, a promising approach is through collective collaboration among multiple narrow AIs. However, the uncontrolled growth of such systems could pose significant risks in the future. To mitigate these risks, we propose the implementation of an artificial prefrontal cortex mechanism within the collaborative framework of narrow AIs. This mechanism functions as both a safety controller and a task switcher, determining which narrow AI should be activated for a given context. Through this architecture, the collaborative system may evolve toward adaptive and safe general intelligence, which is capable of coordination and reasoning, yet constrained by ethical and operational safeguards."}, "authors": [{"id": "2405697076", "name": "Rachmad Imam Tarecha"}, {"id": "2337130719", "name": "Priska Choirina"}, {"id": "2405697096", "name": "Urnika Mudhifatul Jannah"}, {"id": "2405698006", "name": "Bagus Seta Inba Cipta"}, {"id": "2405698203", "name": "Pangestuti Prima Darajat"}, {"id": "2405698041", "name": "Amalia Agung Septarina"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Its applications extend across diagnosis, planning, intraoperative assistance, postoperative monitoring, rehabilitation, prosthetics and education.\n\n\nAPPLICATIONS\nIn diagnostic imaging, AI improves the detection of distal radius and scaphoid fractures, estimates osteoporosis from hand radiographs, identifies triangular fibrocartilage complex injuries on magnetic resonance imaging, segments bones and cartilage, and supports dynamic wrist analysis; ultrasound- and neurophysiological-based models aid carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosis. Prognostic models predict outcomes after carpal tunnel release and thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis with mixed performance. Pre- and intraoperative applications include large language model-based triage and coding, navigation and phase/gesture recognition from surgical video, autonomous microsurgical prototypes and telemanipulator platforms for supermicrosurgery. Artificial intelligence-enabled telemonitoring (e.g. remote photoplethysmography) and video-based mobility tracking support postoperative care and rehabilitation. Vision-guided and multimodal sensing enhance myoelectric prosthesis control.\n\n\nRISKS\nRisks include data privacy and security, algorithmic bias (data, transposition, normative, annotation) and opacity, overreliance with automation bias and skill erosion, and unresolved legal and ethical questions (liability, conflicts of interest, compassion in care).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBalanced adoption requires diversified datasets, privacy-preserving strategies (pseudonymization, differential privacy, federated learning), transparent reporting, AI literacy and ethics in medical education and interfaces that expose uncertainty and employ cognitive forcing functions. Post-deployment surveillance should track data drift, out-of-distribution inputs and performance using automated alerts and multidisciplinary review.

The Machine Perturbational Complexity & Agency Battery (mPCAB) introduces a new, substrate-independent framework that applies neurophysiological methods used initially to assess consciousness in artificial systems. Unlike existing evaluations, it features four key components—perturbational complexity, global workspace assessment, norm internalization, and agency—that link mechanisms with functions. This enables systematic comparisons across digital, neuromorphic, and biological substrates, addressing three research gaps: long-term reasoning with coherent behavior, norm internalization amid distribution shifts, and transformational creativity involving meta-cognitive rule modification. By analyzing theories of consciousness (GNW, IIT, PP, HOT), we identify targets for AI implementation. Our cognitive architecture analysis maps human functions—such as working memory and executive control—to their computational counterparts, providing guiding principles for design. The creativity taxonomy progresses from combinational to transformational, with measurable criteria like changes in conceptual space and the depth of meta-level reasoning. Ethical considerations are integrated into frameworks for monitoring organoid intelligence, reducing bias in creativity, and addressing rights issues. Pilot studies demonstrate mPCAB’s feasibility across different substrates and show that its metrics are comparable. This framework moves evaluation away from superficial benchmarks toward mechanism-based assessment, supporting the development of mind-like machines and responsible AI advancements."}, "authors": [{"id": "152158686", "name": "Sarfaraz K.

We call this phenomenon Artificial Jagged Intelligence (AJI). This paper develops a tractable economic model of AJI that treats adoption as an information problem: users care about \\emph{local} reliability, but typically observe only coarse, global quality signals. In a baseline one-dimensional landscape, truth is a rough Brownian process, and the model ``knows''scattered points drawn from a Poisson process. The model interpolates optimally, and the local error is measured by posterior variance. We derive an adoption threshold for a blind user, show that experienced errors are amplified by the inspection paradox, and interpret scaling laws as denser coverage that improves average quality without eliminating jaggedness. We then study mastery and calibration: a calibrated user who can condition on local uncertainty enjoys positive expected value even in domains that fail the blind adoption test. Modelling mastery as learning a reliability map via Gaussian process regression yields a learning-rate bound driven by information gain, clarifying when discovering ``where the model works''is slow. Finally, we study how scaling interacts with discoverability: when calibrated signals and user mastery accelerate the harvesting of scale improvements, and when opacity can make gains from scaling effectively invisible."}, "authors": [{"id": "2270755268", "name": "Joshua Gans"}], "fields_of_study": ["Economics", "Computer Science"]}

Spectrum sensing, a cornerstone of CR and SI, is critical for identifying underutilized frequency bands and mitigating interference. Traditional methods often struggle in dynamic environments due to their reliance on static models.

However, ensuring users’ quality of experience (QoE) under resource-constrained conditions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce a cross-modal semantic communication transmission scheme for mobile-AIGPV. This scheme generates low-resolution panoramic videos on the edge server and transmits them via cross-modal semantic communication. Furthermore, to better ensure users’ QoE, we propose a panoramic video super-resolution transmission framework based on deep joint source-channel coding (JSCC), named PVSR-JSCC. This framework leverages neural networks (NNs) and attention mechanisms to achieve semantic extraction and adaptive variable-length coding, and performs feature cyclic enhancement based on the motion and context, thereby achieving the panoramic video super-resolution task. Additionally, we design a cross-modal swin transformer block (CMSTB) to enhance the deep JSCC performance. The CMSTB integrates self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms, enabling deep JSCC to capture the intrinsic semantic correlation between text and video. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to the semantic communication scheme directly transmitting high-resolution videos, our proposed PVSR-JSCC not only reduces bandwidth consumption by 36.7% but also lowers computational complexity of the semantic model by 42.8%.

Conventional channel estimation approaches encounter significant scalability limitations in emerging scenarios, such as high-mobility environments, extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) configurations, and multi-band operations, where pilot overhead grows dramatically. CSI extrapolation offers an effective solution to these issues by leveraging limited or partial CSI measurements to reconstruct or predict the full CSI, thereby substantially lowering the required overhead without compromising accuracy. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool to advance CSI extrapolation, enabling more accurate and efficient inference across diverse channel conditions. Although research in this area is expanding rapidly, the literature still lacks a thorough and unified survey that synthesizes the latest developments in AI-based CSI extrapolation methods. This paper aims to bride this gap by providing the first comprehensive review of AI-driven CSI extrapolation techniques, covering their current state, key limitations, and promising research avenues. We begin by outlining the foundational aspects of AI-driven CSI extrapolation. This includes essential wireless channel properties that influence extrapolation performance and an overview of the most commonly employed AI architectures suited to this task. Building on these basics, we systematically examine the major categories of extrapolation approaches, both traditional model-based and modern AI-enhanced ones, across the primary domains: time, frequency, antenna, and multi-domain scenarios.

However, to facilitate specialized generative edge intelligence in dynamic UV networks, GAI models need to tap into local data and conduct online fine-tuning, and the dispersed distribution of UVs makes distributed fine-tuning paradigms crucial. Although the federated generative model fine-tuning brings a potential solution, the large number of parameter transmissions involved in its fine-tuning process are often constrained by communication bottlenecks, which are more pronounced for resource-constrained UV networks. To cope with these challenges, we introduce an energy-efficient GAI model fine-tuning framework for the hierarchical UV networks, which employs over-the-air technology to save computational resource costs for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) during federated aggregation within a federated learning paradigm. Thereafter, we study the resource allocation problem in the fine-tuning process of the generative model and formulate a joint optimization problem for the bandwidth allocation, power control, computation resource allocation, and denoising factor control, aiming to minimize the system energy consumption. Then, we decouple the original problem into four tractable subproblems, and propose a block coordinate descent algorithm to solve them iteratively. Particularly, we derive a closed-form solution for the denoising factor to minimize the local model uploading transmission energy consumption under a specific AirComp communication error threshold. Simulation based on the state-of-the-art generative models shows that our AirComp-assisted federated generative model fine-tuning scheme can achieve satisfactory customized field-of-view image generation capability compared with the traditional fine-tuning scheme in an energy-efficient way."}, "authors": [{"id": "2124209688", "name": "Yikun Zhao"}, {"id": "2191441763", "name": "Lei Feng"}, {"id": "2278708", "name": "F.

Then, to achieve the efficient learning of GSC models deployed on each user, a Personalized Semantic Federated Learning (PSFL) framework is proposed. Specifically, in the local training phase, a Personalized Local Distillation (PLD) approach is employed, where each user selects a tailored GSC model as a mentor based on local resources.

To this end, this paper presents a Deterministic Communication, Computation, and Control (Det3C) integration network architecture, which is composed of four layers, i.e., end, edge, core, and cloud layers. Specifically, the distributed ICPS domains of end layers are responsible for local training of AIGC models. The updated model parameters are aggregated in edge severs and then transmitted to a cloud sever for global aggregation through wide-area core networks.

To obtain optimal ICPS domain selection and computing and temporal (i.e., queue) resource allocation decisions for flow processing and transmission, we formulate a joint optimization problem with the objective to minimize the overall delay of AIGC models.

Namely, the incorporation of such systems will engender subtle but significant changes to the state’s deliberative and organisational structures, its culture, and its capacities – and in ways that could undermine its adherence to international norms of restraint. In offering this provocation, we argue that the gradual proliferation and embeddedness of AI-enabled decision-support systems within the state – what we call the ‘phenomenon of “Borgs in the org”’ – will lead to four significant changes that, together, threaten to diminish the state’s crucial capacity for ‘institutional learning’. Specifically, the state’s reliance on AI-enabled decision-support systems in deliberations over war initiation will invite: (i) disrupted deliberative structures and chains of command; (ii) the occlusion of crucial steps in decision-making processes; (iii) institutionalised deference to computer-generated outputs; and (iv) future plans and trajectories that are overdetermined by past policies and actions. The resulting ‘institutional atrophy’ could, in turn, weaken the state’s responsiveness to external social cues and censure, thereby making the state less likely to engage with, internalise, and adhere to evolving international norms of restraint. As a collateral effect, this weakening could contribute to the decay of these norms themselves if such institutional atrophy were to become widespread within the society of states."}, "authors": [{"id": "2300235134", "name": "Toni Erskine"}, {"id": "2407435526", "name": "Jenny L.

Despite their remarkable capabilities in generating content, these models encounter substantial challenges when producing structured outputs and engaging in dynamic interactions, particularly when they need to retrieve external information in real time. To address these limitations, researchers have developed the ”Function Calling” paradigm. This approach enables language models to analyze user inquiries and engage with defined functions, thereby facilitating precise responses through connections to external sources, including databases, programming interfaces, and live data streams. This functionality has been successfully implemented across numerous sectors such as finance analytics, healthcare systems, and service operations. The implementation of function calling comprises three essential phases: preparation, execution, and processing. The preparation phase encompasses query analysis and function identification. During execution, the system evaluates whether a function is necessary, extracts relevant parameters, and oversees the operation. The processing phase concentrates on analyzing outcomes and crafting appropriate responses. Each phase presents unique difficulties, ranging from accurately selecting functions to managing complex parameter extraction and ensuring reliable execution. Researchers have established various evaluation frameworks and metrics to assess function calling performance, including success rates, computational efficiency, parameter extraction accuracy, and response quality indicators such as ROUGE-L evaluation scores. This survey systematically reviews the current landscape of function calling in LLMs, analyzing technical challenges, examining existing solutions, and discussing evaluation methodologies. We particularly focus on practical implementations and industrial applications, providing insights into both current achievements and future directions in this rapidly evolving field.

Moreover, the training of networks relies on supervised information, and the number of samples is crucial to model performance. This paper proposes a masked transformer model for AMR (MTAMR), comprising two stages: mask training and fine-tuning. The signal is preprocessed into in-phase orthogonal, amplitude phase, and Fourier transform vectors, and then concatenated into a multimodal sequence to obtain a more efficient representation. In the mask training stage, the multimodal sequence is masked by random zeroing, and global features are extracted through the Transformer encoder. Subsequently, these features are processed by two methods to obtain the prediction sequence and classification probability. Considering the homogeneous uncertainty of the prediction and classification tasks, a joint loss with learnable weights is constructed. In the fine-tuning stage, the unmasked multimodal sequence is taken as input, and the cross-entropy loss with a low learning rate is used to update the model.

Despite significant advancements, FL-based modulation decoding faces two primary challenges: (1) Vulnerability to noisy environments - Current studies often prioritize high-quality datasets during training to ensure model performance, which often results in overfitting since real-world signals involve a wide range of noise levels from various sources. (2) Model divergence in non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) environments - The aggregation step in a conventional FL leads to divergence on a large federated scale, resulting in the loss of local-specific knowledge. Moreover, existing FL-based modulation decoding studies typically focus on a single non-IID issue, which limits their ability to generalize across large-scale heterogeneous settings. To address these challenges, we propose FedVaccine, a framework that enhances model generalization across diverse noise conditions and non-IID data environments. Instead of relying on high-quality datasets that risk overfitting, FedVaccine employs a harmonic noise resilience approach—akin to a vaccination effect—that deliberately exposes the model to controlled noise, identifying noise tolerance, regularizing training, and ensuring robust decoding performance across varying noise levels. Additionally, FedVaccine incorporates a Federated Split Learning approach to cumulatively update the global model, ensuring adaptive recalibration and mitigating the loss of local knowledge during aggregation.

To address these issues, it is crucial yet challenging to design an effective DSFL scheduling strategy that determines whether and when to pull models from contact satellites and perform local training for optimizing DSFL performance. In this paper, we propose a contact-based DSFL framework and formulate the DSFL scheduling problem to maximize the accuracy of trained models.

Under a learning-to-learn paradigm, we develop a Multi-agent Dueling Double Deep Q Network (MA3DQN)-based intelligent DSFL scheduling strategy. The agents, trained in a distributed and alternating manner, adaptively make scheduling decisions based on instantaneous partial observations of the environment.

Rapid response to multiple landslide events demands accurate, all-weather, day-and-night detection capabilities. Optical remote sensing has advanced landslide detection but remains limited under adverse weather and lighting conditions. Synthetic Aperture Radar, resilient to these constraints, remains underexplored for automated landslide detection due to challenges such as complex pre-processing and geometric distortions. This study integrates Deep Neural Networks with Sentinel-1 backscatter data for co-seismic landslide detection, utilizing a data-centric approach. We train and test the models using 11 earthquake-induced widespread landslide events, covering ≈ 73 000 landslides across diverse geologic and climatic settings. Inference on unseen events in Haiti (2021) and Sumatra (2022) demonstrates robust transferability, achieving F1-scores up to 82 %. Using explainable artificial intelligence, we highlight the discriminative capability of change detection bands over backscatter alone.

The findings identify a structural pattern—termed the emotional funnelling phenomenon—where AI‐related risks and uncertainty concentrate in leadership positions, producing sustained anxiety and, at times, hopelessness. In contrast, technically or creatively oriented roles, structurally insulated from exam‐related accountability, experienced curiosity, enjoyment and a strong sense of control. A different emotional trajectory emerged for the practitioner responsible for reading items, who reported boredom and grievance stemming from the repetitive verification of unreliable AI outputs, compounded by the sense that her labour was undervalued by colleagues and under‐recognised within the institution.

Accurate traffic prediction is crucial for reducing congestion, improving travel efficiency, and enhancing traffic safety. However, the complex and dynamically changing spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic networks make the prediction task highly challenging. Most existing methods rely on self-attention mechanisms to capture these spatio-temporal dependencies, which often result in high computational complexity. Furthermore, although traffic systems can be modeled as graph structures, graph convolutional network (GCN), which effectively capture correlations between nodes, typically depend on predefined or adaptive adjacency matrices. These approaches struggle to cope with the highly dynamic nature of real-world traffic systems. To address these issues, we propose a spatio-temporal mamba dynamic graph convolutional recurrent neural network (STMAGRN). This model first leverages the mamba framework to extract spatio-temporal features from traffic sequences. The mamba model, through its unique selective state space mechanism and linear time complexity, achieves efficient sequence processing. Next, we design a spatio-temporal memory module (STM), which identifies and extracts traffic pattern features most similar to the input data, and learns intrinsic representative traffic patterns from the data associated with each node. These patterns are then used to dynamically generate graph structures, providing GCN with real-time updated graph data. Finally, we combine GCN with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to extract both spatial and temporal features simultaneously. We conducted extensive experiments on six real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that STMAGRN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in traffic prediction tasks."}, "authors": [{"id": "2115795460", "name": "Xiaoyan Zhang"}, {"id": "2333531232", "name": "Yongqin Zhang"}, {"id": "2315479217", "name": "Xiangfu Meng"}], "fields_of_study": null}

From an artificial intelligence perspective, this paper proposes an enhanced multiagent reinforcement learning framework that employs action estimation neural networks to infer agent behaviors. By integrating a lightweight action estimation module, each agent infers neighboring agents'behaviors using only locally observable information, enabling collaborative policy learning without explicit action sharing. This approach is fully compatible with standard TD3 algorithms and scalable to larger multiagent systems. At the engineering application level, this framework has been implemented and validated in dual-arm robotic manipulation tasks: two robotic arms collaboratively lift objects.

The framework jointly optimizes model splitting layers, client-UAV pairing, and computational resource allocation of UAVs. Then, we formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem with objectives of weighted averages of single-round training latency and client energy consumption, subject to UAV energy and computational resource constraints. To solve the complex joint optimization problem, we formalize this problem as a markov decision process (MDP) and design a distributed synchronous deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on proximal policy optimization, achieving efficient joint resource scheduling through parallel training and synchronous policy updates. The simulation results prove that the proposed solution outperforms existing benchmarks in both performance of latency and energy efficiency."}, "authors": [{"id": "2323463060", "name": "Haotai Zhao"}, {"id": "2391254070", "name": "Jie Ruan"}, {"id": "2391637683", "name": "Xinyao Zhang"}, {"id": "2283977275", "name": "Miao Liu"}, {"id": "2338862692", "name": "Jie Yang"}, {"id": "2307474811", "name": "Hongbo Zhu"}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science"]}

Third, human decision makers operate within institutional structures with internal audit trails and organisational cultures, inter-agency networks and intelligence-sharing partnerships that may mitigate the risks of human deskilling.

This paper will address the role of AI-driven knowledge integration (AIEKI) as regulated by innovation, such as the digital absorptive capacity (DAC), and ethical guidance, such as ethical knowledge curation (EKC) in the same breath. This paper aims to investigate the impact of these factors on the economic performance and sustainable innovation performance of an organization.\n \n \n \n As a quantitative study, a survey was mailed to 295 IT professionals in various locations. To determine the quality of fit of this study’s model, item validity and data reliability, the authors used structural equation modeling (SEM) through partial least squares-based SEM.\n \n \n \n The findings reveal that AI-enabled knowledge integration improves digital absorptive capacity and ethical knowledge curation. The fact that these elements also play a crucial role in enhancing sustainable innovation performance underscores the importance of incorporating artificial intelligence in the value creation process. In addition, it was found that knowledge system complexity influenced certain of these relationships, indicating that the more complex the system was, the stronger the sociomaterial connections.\n \n \n \n The findings are highly practical and offer clear recommendations for practitioners. Managers need to move beyond the focus on artificial intelligence technology and tool sets to the investment on the integrated sociomaterial capabilities of digital absorptive capacity and ethical knowledge curation. In other words, they will be able to roll out training initiatives to teach their employees how to integrate artificial intelligence with DAC. They can also stress on the importance of sound governance practices. This two-faceted strategy is effective in making AI-enabled innovations not only economical, but also socially accountable and sustainable.\n \n \n \n Such research has the value of originality because (a) it conducts robust empirical evidence of the sociomateriality theory in terms of knowledge processes and AI (b) and translates the artificial intelligence ethics discussion into practice, branding the field of curating knowledge ethically (CKE) as a digital absorptive capacity (capability) (c). For managers, the study offers a two-way approach to implementing artificial intelligence, aiming to achieve both productivity and sustainability.\n"}, "authors": [{"id": "2406976828", "name": "Jian Wang"}, {"id": "2406782999", "name": "Mehmood Khan"}, {"id": "2375503081", "name": "Nourah O.

The model was tested with survey data from 384 English teachers in Arab schools under Israeli jurisdiction using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Results show that perceived ethical commitment and competence in artificial intelligence–related pedagogy strongly predict teachers’ intention to use these tools ethically; this intention, in turn, is the strongest predictor of student learning outcomes, exceeding the effect of reported classroom practices. Effort expectancy and social influence did not meaningfully predict ethical intention.

Artificial intelligence is increasingly replacing human decision-making in many aspects of life, and the legal domain is no exception. Consequently, it is essential to explore how these technologies can contribute to the development and drafting of laws, as well as the challenges they may pose to existing legal frameworks.\nWhile this progress raises complex legal challenges that require careful analysis, artificial intelligence also offers promising opportunities to enhance the quality and effectiveness of legislation. This study therefore seeks to analyze the role of artificial intelligence in the legislative process, with a focus on the opportunities and challenges it presents in this context. The first section examines the role of artificial intelligence in the legal field in general, while the second section is devoted specifically to its role in improving the quality of legislation. In this regard, the study explores how artificial intelligence can be used to analyze vast amounts of legal data, thereby enhancing legislators’ ability to make more informed and accurate decisions.

This study investigates the influence of digital literacy and the utilization of artificial intelligence on English writing proficiency. Using a quantitative explanatory survey design, data were collected from fifty-five undergraduate students selected through purposive sampling at a private university. The study employed a structured questionnaire to measure information evaluation, ethical awareness, and artificial intelligence usage patterns. Data analysis was conducted using Structural Equation Modeling based on Partial Least Squares. The results demonstrate that digital literacy significantly enhances writing proficiency by enabling students to evaluate sources and maintain ethical standards. Similarly, the utilization of artificial intelligence positively impacts writing outcomes, particularly in improving grammatical accuracy and lexical sophistication. Furthermore, the simultaneous interaction of these variables serves as a strong predictor of overall writing competence. The findings conclude that while artificial intelligence provides essential technical support, digital literacy remains the critical cognitive foundation for effective usage. These insights suggest that higher education institutions should prioritize integrated curriculums that combine technical training with robust digital literacy education to foster independent and proficient academic writers."}, "authors": [{"id": "114077208", "name": "U.

An investigation of the operational sustainability associated with the generative artificial intelligence systems would be crucial, as it would provide information about how these systems match ideals such as efficiency, circularity and environmental responsibility. We explore how users understand and engage with sustainability principles, specifically lean, circular and green operational frameworks within generative artificial intelligence environments. We collect user reviews of 72 recently launched generative AI platforms from 2022 to 2024 and utilise advanced machine learning methods, including Word2Vec modelling, sentiment and regression analysis, to reveal how text datasets reflect customer perceptions.

Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly significant role in medicine and has the potential to assist not only specialists but also other medical professionals in detecting fractures based on X-ray and CT scans. Algorithms based on deep learning are particularly useful in radiology and orthopedics.\nPurpose of the study. Summary of publicly available publications and studies comparing the effectiveness of AI and physicians in recognizing bone fractures.\nMaterials and methodology. A review of the literature available on PubMed, Google Scholar and Scopus was conducted.\nConclusions. The use of artificial intelligence algorithms can reduce the time required for fracture detection to as little as one minute. AI is better at identifying fractures that are difficult for humans to detect but struggles with more obvious and visible fractures. Artificial intelligence has the same or lower sensitivity and specificity in fracture detection as a specialist doctor but achieves higher accuracy compared to a resident doctor or a general practitioner.\nSummary. Based on the analyzed studies, it can be observed that artificial intelligence  will prove useful as an aid; a suggestion in diagnosis for a young doctor, but does not replace specialist doctors, who achieve higher accuracy in detecting fractures on X-rays and CT scans. Furthermore, it is worth reconsidering the reanalysis of existing studies and comparing AI results not only with human knowledge but also with CT scans, as they are considered more reliable."}, "authors": [{"id": "2392154693", "name": "Maria Kasprzak"}, {"id": "2392158420", "name": "Damian Osiński"}, {"id": "2392153385", "name": "Zuzanna Kawa"}, {"id": "2392153588", "name": "Aleksandra Jędrzejewska"}, {"id": "2392153340", "name": "Aleksandra Jureczko"}, {"id": "2183643174", "name": "Klaudia Kleczaj"}, {"id": "2392156700", "name": "Valentyna Levadna"}, {"id": "2392153108", "name": "Julia Jaworowska"}, {"id": "2392153095", "name": "Gabriela Babiarz"}, {"id": "2392155992", "name": "Julia Kanarszczuk"}], "fields_of_study": null}

The research used primary data collected through a convenience questionnaire directed to Indonesian e-commerce customers who have used the PayLater feature. The findings of the research show that Artificial Intelligence (AI) personalization positively and significantly influences User Experience as well as the decision to use PayLater. In addition, User Experience partially mediates the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) personalization on the decision to use PayLater, thus strengthening the initial relationship. The good scope of the research model in explaining and influencing the dependent variable is indicated by the R² value. Recommendations include the need to strengthen the Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered system to I mprove User Experience and foster the use of formal digital financial services."}, "authors": [{"id": "2408322371", "name": "Ardine Ariella Hassya"}, {"id": "2408323479", "name": "Debi Irawan"}, {"id": "2408323477", "name": "Fadhlanrashif Ibrahim Supriyana"}, {"id": "2408323582", "name": "Athia Saelan"}, {"id": "2408322460", "name": "Arief Hertadi Rustam"}], "fields_of_study": null}

As AI technologies continue to evolve at a rapid pace, the landscape of personal financial consulting is experiencing significant transformation. By leveraging deep learning and big data analytics, and using examples such as JIMI and JD.COM, this study illustrates how AI-driven financial advisors can interpret market trends with greater precision and deliver more accurate, highly personalized financial guidance to users. It further elaborates on how, within an AI-supported environment, financial users can access round-the-clock advisory services, enabling them to log into digital platforms at any time to seek guidance on financial matters, to which AI systems respond promptly and efficiently. Considering that the capital market is constantly fluctuating and characterized by various uncertainties—and that many investors still lack adequate understanding of financial decision-making—the adoption of artificial intelligence in financial management has become increasingly appealing to users. Moreover, its integration not only enhances user experience but also contributes positively to the broader development of the capital market.\n\nKeywords: Artificial intelligence model, Personalized smart financial advisor, Smart financial management, Robo-advising"}, "authors": [{"id": null, "name": "Padmini Mishra"}, {"id": "2408297520", "name": "Ishant Shrivastava"}, {"id": "2408277627", "name": "Manish Yadav"}, {"id": "2408355879", "name": "Anshika Singh"}], "fields_of_study": null}

The paper analyses the adverse effects of artificial intelligence, particularly in chatbots, focusing on the risks of misinformation, polarization and algorithmic discrimination. The evolution of chatbots is explored, from rule-based systems to advanced language models such as A.L.I.C.E.®, Replika®, ChatGPT®, Bard® and DeepSeek®. This entails the hypothesis that the increasing sophistication of chatbots, from rule-based systems to advanced language models, leads to a rise in the risks of misinformation, polarization, and algorithmic discrimination, thus, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XIA) emerges as a crucial tool to mitigate these adverse effects, although its application in different chatbots presents strengths and weaknesses in terms of explainability. The methodology used combines the responsible and ethical use of AI, driven by XIA, that essential to ensure that technology benefits society. Furthermore, Explained Artificial Intelligence (XIA) is proposed as a solution to mitigate these risks through explainability of AI systems.

Methodology: A qualitative, bibliographic-documentary study was conducted, based on a systematic search in SCOPUS and Dimensions.ai. Through a rigorous selection and thematic filtering process, a final corpus of studies published between 2021 and 2025 was compiled, which were analyzed using documentary analysis matrices and content analysis techniques. Results: The results showed that, although there is a growing volume of research on ICT and sustainability, only a small proportion explicitly addresses the environmental impact of virtual education. It was noted that there are more macroeconomic and sectoral approaches, and that few specific environmental indicators are used for digital educational environments. It was also observed that artificial intelligence has been studied primarily as a tool to improve technological efficiency, with little focus on how it can reduce the ecological impact of education. Conclusions: It was determined that the digital ecological footprint of virtual education is a topic understudied in scientific literature, highlighting the need for concrete research that integrates sustainability, digital education, and artificial intelligence.

Traditional project-based implementation approaches are often inadequate for dealing with the long-term, cross-functional and high-risk nature of AI systems in safety-critical and mission-critical environments. This article investigates strategic program management models as an enabling frame for secure and sustainable adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in critical IT infrastructure. It examines the shortcomings associated with ad hoc and siloed AI deployment strategies and makes the case for program level governance structures with integrated security, compliance, risk, and lifecycle oversight. The paper investigates established program management models such as governance-driven, capability based, and hybrid adaptive and assesses their appropriateness for AI initiatives that work in the face of stringent regulatory and cybersecurity constraints. Key enablers such as stakeholder alignment, security-by-design, continuous risk assessment and organizational maturity are discussed in the context of critical infrastructure requirements. The article further suggests a structured program management approach that will bring the AI innovation together with security assurance, regulatory compliance, and operation resilience. By synthesizing the insights from program management theory, cybersecurity governance and from artificial intelligence lifecycle management, this study provides organizations with both a practical framework and strategic foundation to responsibly deploy AI in critical IT environments."}, "authors": [{"id": "2405607861", "name": "Kumar Saurabh"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Despite statements that he would not do so, President Joe Biden pardoned his son, Hunter Biden, for firearms and tax-related offenses. Weeks later, President Donald Trump pardoned individuals who were convicted of crimes associated with the January 6, 2021, events on Capitol Hill. Each administration’s postconviction relief decisions were critiqued on similar grounds, namely, that they were unprincipled, self-interested, or partisan. These examples highlight the importance of fairness, justice, and coherence associated with postconviction review and postconviction relief. Interestingly, the recent transition between the Biden and Trump administrations occurred during a unique period that was characterized by two other major developments: the rise of artificial intelligence and a renewed emphasis on government efficiency. These two developments may catalyze significant reforms to the postconviction review process to counteract a specific type of government waste and abuse: excessive prison sentences. Drawing on the insights of public administration scholarship, this article argues that artificial intelligence may help improve postconviction review and postconviction relief in certain respects. It argues that artificial intelligence can be used to identify eligible persons for second-look resentencing and clemency, facilitate applications for postconviction review, and streamline the evaluation of postconviction review claims. It demonstrates how artificially intelligent clemency may improve efficiency, fairness, and access to justice. It also highlights important barriers that limit AI’s potential and effectiveness in postconviction review contexts."}, "authors": [{"id": "2406712047", "name": "Terry Skolnik"}], "fields_of_study": null}

While global debates on artificial intelligence ethics usually center on secular or practical structures, the Greek Orthodox heritage brings a distinct moral dimension inspired by spiritual anthropology, the theology of the human person, and the notion of heavenly likeness. The study looks at Greek consumers' perceptions of artificial intelligence from ethical, moral, and religious angles depending on data gathered from the author's Ph.D. dissertation (omitted for blind review). It examines the degree to which religion influences public opinion, acceptance, and emotional engagement with smart systems. The research reveals that individuals occasionally evaluate artificial intelligence (AI) not only for its utility but also for its fit with their moral values, spiritual integrity, and freedom. By fusing Orthodox ethical principles with modern AI debate, this paper presents a novel conceptual framework: the Theological-Moral Framing Model of AI. This theory clarifies how group and individual reactions to new technologies are influenced by cultural identity, moral narratives, and religious beliefs. The paper argues that in Greece and other faith-based nations, developing culturally sensitive AI management and public relations strategies depends on an awareness of this religious aspect. \n  \nReceived: 25 November 2025 / Accepted: 30 December 2025 / Published: January 2026"}, "authors": [{"id": "2404912133", "name": "Theofanis Aritzis"}], "fields_of_study": null}

This article critically examines how generative artificial intelligence, while often celebrated for accessibility and linguistic support, can foster learner dependency and undermine the development of sustained cognitive engagement. Drawing on extended classroom observations and reflective teaching practice within a United Arab Emirates higher education context, the study identifies recurring patterns of disengagement, superficial linguistic understanding, and a growing reluctance to grapple with language complexity. These behaviors are conceptualized through the notion of the Brat Brain, a metaphor used to describe a learner mindset that resists effort and critical thinking, demands instant solutions, and privileges convenience over intellectual growth. Rather than asking how to improve their writing or speaking, students increasingly question why such effort is necessary when artificial intelligence can produce faster and seemingly superior outputs. Reframing artificial intelligence use through the good, the bad, and the (educationally) evil, the article offers a critical lens for evaluating both the affordances and the unintended consequences of artificial fluency in language education. The study’s significance lies in its contribution to current debates on artificial intelligence in education by highlighting the pedagogical risks of uncritical adoption and arguing for a recalibration of instructional practices grounded in critical digital literacy, intellectual responsibility, and human-centered learning."}, "authors": [{"id": "2073186552", "name": "Masuda Wardak"}], "fields_of_study": null}

In the context of AI and analytics in virtual medicine, it aims to improve the provision of healthcare services. This also aligns with the Omani Health Ministry’s Health 2050 document. Rapid advances in artificial intelligence technology present a host of ethical and legal challenges, including algorithmic bias, opacity, privacy violations, diminished patient self-determination, and legal accountability gaps surrounding malpractice. This study seeks to examine the primary legislative initiatives concerning the Omani legislative response to artificial intelligence in the healthcare system and to consider the scope of artificial intelligence and its systems and entities, as well as the civil liability it may entail. This research examines these challenges and the processes of case documenting the attempts to control the use of artificial intelligence technology through a descriptive-analytical method. The study, to the extent available legal structures reach, examines the legal challenges for which, in the absence of consideration, far more robust legal structures need to be developed.

Explainable artificial intelligence has emerged to address this challenge; however, most existing approaches rely exclusively on global or local analyses, which fail to capture the heterogeneity of model behavior across patient populations. In this paper, we introduce the clustered partial explanation (CPE) framework, a novel three‐level methodology comprising global, partial, and local analyses, designed to bridge this gap. The proposed framework combines cluster‐based subgrouping with explainable artificial intelligence techniques to uncover latent variations in feature influence and model behavior. We apply the proposed framework to a breast cancer survival prediction task using a Random Forest model trained on the SEER dataset. The resulting partial explanations reveal heterogeneous feature importance patterns across clusters, highlighting interactions that remain obscured under global analysis. By validating global explanations at the subgroup level, the proposed framework enhances both interpretability and reliability, thereby supporting context‐aware clinical decision‐making. Finally, we discuss the implications of this additional interpretability layer for future research."}, "authors": [{"id": "8691742", "name": "Khadija Letrache"}, {"id": "2277662511", "name": "Mohammed Ramdani"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Kondisi ini menunjukkan bahwa penggunaan AI dalam MSDM tidak hanya berdampak teknis, tetapi juga memiliki implikasi etis dan strategis yang signifikan. Oleh karena itu, diperlukan kajian komprehensif untuk memahami implikasi penggunaan AI dalam konteks MSDM secara lebih mendalam. Artikel ini bertujuan untuk mensintesis literatur terkini mengenai penerapan AI dalam MSDM dengan fokus pada implikasi etis, peran strategis MSDM, serta dampaknya terhadap kinerja organisasi. Penelitian ini menggunakan pendekatan Systematic Literature Review (SLR) berdasarkan pedoman PRISMA 2020 dengan penelusuran pada basis data Scopus dan Web of Science terhadap artikel jurnal peer-reviewed yang diterbitkan pada periode 2021–2025. Dari proses seleksi diperoleh 47 artikel yang dianalisis secara tematik. Hasil kajian menunjukkan bahwa penelitian AI dalam MSDM masih didominasi oleh studi konseptual dan berfokus pada konteks negara maju, dengan isu etika sebagai tema utama. AI berpotensi mereproduksi bias historis, memperluas praktik pengawasan karyawan, serta menimbulkan tantangan dalam membangun kepercayaan organisasi. Kontribusi AI terhadap kinerja organisasi bersifat etis-kondisional, sehingga menegaskan pentingnya penguatan tata kelola etika yang terintegrasi dalam MSDM strategis."}, "authors": [{"id": "74010446", "name": "Erni Kurniawati"}, {"id": "1661102300", "name": "Dewi Asiyah"}, {"id": "89271542", "name": "Awalya Awalya"}, {"id": "2404901096", "name": "Ernest Ceti Septyanti"}, {"id": "114340520", "name": "Binti Isrofin"}, {"id": "2091175673", "name": "Joko Sutarto"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Data dikumpulkan lewat wawancara mendalam (sama guru, staf IT, dan kepala sekolah), observasi langsung di kelas dan saat pemanfaatan perangkat digital, plus studi dokumen terkait kebijakan dan sarana IT sekolah. Untuk analisisnya, data dipilah (reduksi), disajikan secara tematik, dan ditarik kesimpulannya. Kita juga pakai Analisis SWOT buat memetakan kekuatan, kelemahan, peluang, dan ancaman. SMP Pertiwi itu punya modal awal yang bagus ada lab komputer, perangkat, dan dukungan manajemen. Tapi, ada kendala krusial juga. Misalnya, bandwidth internet yang suka drop saat jam sibuk, ketersediaan perangkat yang belum merata, kemampuan digital guru yang masih beragam, dan yang paling penting, belum ada kebijakan resmi soal etika dan perlindungan data terkait penggunaan AI. Berdasarkan temuan tadi, ada beberapa rekomendasi strategis yang diusulkan seperti upgrade infrastruktur secara prioritas, bikin modul pelatihan guru berjenjang yang fokus ke teknis dan pedagogi AI, merumuskan panduan etika penggunaan AI, dan memperkuat kemitraan eksternal untuk bantuan teknis dan evaluasi dampak.

A scientometric review of 441 publications (2009–2025) guided the systematic assembly of a dataset comprising 363 SFGPC mixes. Five ML models were trained to predict compressive strength (fc), with Gradient Boosting (GB) achieving the highest accuracy, yielding R2 = 0.954, RMSE = 3.15 MPa, MAE = 1.81 MPa during training, and R2 = 0.95, RMSE = 3.128 MPa, MAE = 2.41 MPa during testing. Multi-layered XAI analysis identified age, slag content, and alkaline-to-binder ratio as the most influential parameters and revealed governing nonlinear interactions. Sustainability assessment showed that the fly ash-dominant mix exhibited the lowest global warming potential (156 kg CO2-eq/m3), the most favourable sustainability index, and the smallest residual emissions after a 25% carbon offset. A user-oriented graphical user interface (GUI) was developed for real-time strength prediction.

However, beneath the glorious appearance of the rapid development of AI technology, increasingly serious environmental problems are gradually emerging. To train and operate AI systems, power demand from data centers has skyrocketed, having tripled in just five years and being expected to triple again by 2030 [1]. This staggering increase starkly contrasts with less than 3% of annual global electricity production growth witnessed over the past 40 years, far outpaced by AI's ballooning energy needs [2], as shown in Figure 1 left. If we continue down this path relying on traditional processors, the growth of large language models (LLMs) may soon reach an unsustainable ceiling. This urgency is amplified by the reality that early efficiency gains in AI hardware are plateauing. Data centers nowadays principally utilize GPUs for both training and inferences. While GPU manufacturers often highlight improvements in efficiency—claiming a 40,000x improvement over the past decade—these numbers obscure several underlying concerns [3]. Upon scrutinizing the sources of the improvement, it becomes evident that sustaining such a pace of progress will be fraught with challenges. The main drivers of efficiency enhancement stem from circuit/architecture innovations, semiconductor process advancements, and data format optimizations."}, "authors": [{"id": "2317832938", "name": "Hechen Wang"}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science"]}

However, the growing diversity of industrial products and user requirements presents challenges in effectively matching industrial users with suitable design solutions or manufacturing resources. Recommendation systems, particularly those based on Collaborative Filtering (CF), have emerged as powerful tools to address this issue by leveraging user preferences and behavioral data. Nevertheless, traditional CF algorithms often encounter efficiency bottlenecks when processing the high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and dynamic data typical of Industry 5.0 environments.To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a clustering-based CF algorithm that improves recommendation efficiency by incorporating industrial user relationship modeling. Furthermore, a Density-Sensitive Distance Transformer (DSD-Transformer) framework is developed to enhance clustering precision and recommendation accuracy. Experimental evaluations conducted on real industrial datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing methods in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, making it well suited for Industry 5.0-oriented intelligent recommendation and decision-support applications."}, "authors": [{"id": "2379595050", "name": "Ru Rao"}, {"id": "2333725837", "name": "Xinping Li"}, {"id": "2373794200", "name": "Jie Zhang"}, {"id": "2263419787", "name": "Xiaoqun Dai"}, {"id": "2302819855", "name": "Song Guo"}, {"id": "2277159570", "name": "Xianyi Zeng"}], "fields_of_study": null}

These gains are attractive, but in a regulated environment speed is never enough. Regulators want assurance that every system is reliable, that decisions are explainable, and that human accountability remains central. This paper sets out a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) AI approach for Computer System Validation (CSV) and Computer Software Assurance (CSA). It relies on explainable AI (XAI) tools but keeps structured human review in place, so automation can be used without creating gaps in trust or accountability. Within this framework, AI provides draft recommendations such as mapping user requirements, highlighting redundant tests, or classifying deviations while subject matter experts (SMEs) review, adjust, and approve the final outcomes. Features like rationale cards, confidence bands, and traceable recommendations give SMEs the information they need to understand and, when necessary, challenge AI outputs. The framework is also supported by governance measures. These include model risk tiering to match oversight with potential impact, periodic model challenges to detect drift, and “evidence packs” that bring together AI outputs, human decisions, and audit trails into an inspection-ready format. Taken together, these safeguards show inspectors that automation is being used responsibly, not recklessly. We validate the approach in a two-project pilot, reporting mean cycle-time reductions of 32% (95% CI: 25%–38%) and higher inter-rater agreement (κ from 0.71 → 0.85), achieved under a defined governance model that includes model-risk tiering, quarterly challenge testing for high-risk models, and inspection-ready evidence packs aligned to 21 CFR Part 11 and Annex 11. These results provide preliminary empirical support so that HITL AI can improve efficiency and reviewer consistency while preserving accountability and regulatory trust. Practical case examples demonstrate that HITL AI can shorten validation cycles by 25%–40% while also improving reviewer consistency and strengthening inspector confidence. Rather than replacing SMEs, the system frees them from repetitive work so they can focus on risk and quality the areas where their judgment adds the most value. By blending automation with accountability, HITL AI provides a path for digital transformation that regulators are more likely to accept, positioning it as both a productivity tool and a model for sustainable compliance in the years ahead."}, "authors": [{"id": "2407390453", "name": "Manaliben Amin"}], "fields_of_study": null}

In this work, we propose a Hierarchical Brain-Inspired Reinforcement Learning (HBRL) architecture that combines the benefits of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with a biologically inspired cognitive hierarchy. The proposed architecture functions by simulating cortical–subcortical processing of information in which a high-level Policy-Gradient manager conducts abstract and long-term planning, and the low-level Deep Q-Network (DQN) agents complete real-time short-term actions. The proposed architecture’s multilayer structure includes temporal abstraction, modular learning, and the ability to refine policies to optimize experience, which makes it appropriate for dynamic and uncertain environments. We applied HBRL in three common scenarios: GridWorld, autonomous vehicle navigation, and smart-city infrastructure control to evaluate the proposed system design. Overall, we found that HBRL had a 15%–20% higher rate of completing tasks, 1.4–2.4 times faster learning efficiency, along with 70–100 points higher cumulative reward when high-level and low-level HBRL agents were compared to baseline approaches (e.g., DQN, Proximal Policy Optimization, and Soft Actor-Critic). A statistical analysis using two-tailed t-tests also assessed the significance of improvements (p < 0.01) among all tested environments. The hierarchical decomposition of tasks serves both to promote convergence and improve agents’ generalization capacity in unseen conditions. In its entirety, the proposed HBRL framework provides a scalable and cognitive-inspired learning paradigm for developing intelligent autonomous systems that exhibit human-likeadaptability and efficient decision-making capabilities in complex, nonstationary real-world environments.\n \nReceived: 14 May 2025 | Revised: 16 October 2025 | Accepted: 19 December 2025\n \nConflicts of Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest to this work.\n \nData Availability Statement\nData sharing is not applicable to this article as no new data were created or analyzed in this study.\n \nAuthor Contribution Statement\nKanthavel Radhakrishnan: Conceptualization, Methodology, Formal analysis, Resources, Data curation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review & editing, Visualization.

Data dikumpulkan dari literatur klasik pemikir Islam seperti Al-Ghazali dan Ibn Khaldun, serta literatur kontemporer yang membahas filsafat pendidikan, etika teknologi, dan transformasi digital, antara lain Nasr, Jasser Auda, Selwyn, serta Hussain dan Khan. Analisis data dilakukan menggunakan pendekatan hermeneutik-filosofis untuk menggali makna, nilai, dan relevansi konsep-konsep tersebut dalam konteks pendidikan digital. Hasil kajian menunjukkan bahwa filsafat manajemen pendidikan Islam berfungsi sebagai kerangka normatif dan strategis dalam mengarahkan digitalisasi pendidikan agar tetap berorientasi pada nilai, etika, dan spiritualitas. Integrasi nilai tauhid melahirkan model konseptual Manajemen Pendidikan Islam Digital Integratif (MPIDI) yang terdiri dari empat komponen utama, yaitu nilai tauhid, etika digital, teknologi, dan kemaslahatan umat. Model ini menegaskan bahwa keberhasilan transformasi digital dalam pendidikan Islam tidak hanya ditentukan oleh kesiapan teknologi, tetapi juga oleh kesiapan nilai, kesadaran etis, dan kedalaman spiritual."}, "authors": [{"id": "144412809", "name": "H.

This technology can enhance perceived usability and immersion, creating a more realistic online shopping experience. However, consumers still combine physical and digital experiences to ensure the best purchasing decisions. Consumers visit physical stores and purchase products online, a process known as showrooming. This phenomenon is an evolving challenge for both retail and academics. This research examines the influence of channel characteristics (antecedents) and situational characteristics (consumers’ time pressure) as a moderating variable on showrooming behavior phenomena and avoidance of regret as consequences. This research surveys a representative sample of 474 Indonesian cosmetics and skincare shoppers. This study uses SmartPLS 4.0 to analyze the data. The results prove that channel characteristics (sales-staff assistance), online channel convenience, and social influence positively affect showrooming intentions. Then, showrooming behavior helps consumers reduce uncertainty, positively impacting avoidance of regret as consequences. By integrating the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Stimulus–Organism–Behavior–Consequence (SOBC) framework, this research model provides a comprehensive understanding of how external factors influence consumers’ psychological processes, which then shape their intentions and behaviors. Ultimately, showrooming behavior results in post-purchase consequences. This model integration is expected to analyze showrooming behavior in a more holistic modern retail context. The findings of this study provide practical implications for retailers in formulating more effective strategies for managing consumer behavior in an omnichannel environment."}, "authors": [{"id": "2340122724", "name": "Lia Febria Lina"}, {"id": "2404341947", "name": "N.

This research offers a conceptual framework, AI Constructivist Learning Model (AICLM), based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Constructivist Learning Theory (CLT). Motivation, engagement, and societal expectations, based on CLT, are identified as external variables in TAM. These three constructs support active, autonomous, and student-centered learning. A systematic search of academic databases was conducted following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Sixteen empirical studies published from 2021 to 2025, indexed in Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, were included in this review. Articles were selected on the basis of certain keywords such as, AI, English writing, TAM, and CLT. Findings indicate that students perceive the ease of use and usefulness of AI if they have high motivation, more engagement, and positive societal expectations. Therefore, motivation, engagement, and societal expectations are significant external variables that influence the attitudes of students toward AI acceptance in improving English writing. AI integration in English writing development can be successful if the interaction between the constructs of TAM and CLT is understood well. CLT supports why and how students engage actively with AI tools. Students are more likely to accept AI if it increases motivation enhances engagement and fulfils societal expectations. This conceptual framework is significant for future researchers and teachers in designing effective AI-based writing instructional strategies and curricula."}, "authors": [{"id": "2203452561", "name": "Hafiza Sana Mansoor"}, {"id": "81135286", "name": "Bambang Sumardjoko"}, {"id": "66714031", "name": "Anam Sutopo"}], "fields_of_study": null}

This lack of transparency and clinical alignment poses major challenges for regulatory compliance and professional trust. This study proposes a novel hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) meta-model for CDSS design, which formally translates established engineering decision support paradigms into the clinical domain to create systems that are inherently safer and more explainable. The framework rigorously integrates: (i) Web Ontology Language 2 for formalizing medical concepts; (ii) a semantic web rule language rule base to serve as “clinical guardrails” for enforcing evidence-based guidelines and safety constraints; and (iii) a modular inference policy that intelligently matches decision problems with specific data-driven or probabilistic methods. A prototype was implemented, combining this explicit knowledge layer with modular inference engines and template-based explanations. Evaluation across two large-scale clinical tasks (oncology using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database and intensive care using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV database) demonstrated superior performance over data-driven baselines. Specifically, the hybrid system achieved a 78% reduction in guideline-violation errors (reducing the contraindication rate from 18% to 6%) while maintaining high predictive accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.84 and 0.87, respectively). Furthermore, a clinician usability study confirmed that the transparent, knowledge-driven explanations resulted in significantly higher decision clarity (Likert rating of 6.2/7) and reduced cognitive load. The findings validate that this hybrid AI architecture represents a robust and transferable approach to designing clinically aligned, trustworthy, and explainable CDSS, directly addressing critical requirements for the responsible deployment of AI in healthcare."}, "authors": [{"id": "2354899507", "name": "N.

Such AI-based tools could be integrated and potentially offer advantages over currently used diagnostic and monitoring algorithms, enabling the pursue of more individualized treatment options with potentially improved patient outcomes in the future. However, very few studies exploring the potential of AI-based tools have been reported in veterinary medicine. Diagnosis and subclassification of chronic inflammatory enteropathy (CIE) and protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), requiring an integrated approach including several diagnostic modalities, remains a challenge in clinical canine gastroenterology and might benefit from AI-based tools. Thus, we aimed to use AI-based deep learning to develop a model that can differentiate clinical cases of protein-losing PLE from non-PLE CIE using ultrasonographic (B-mode) images. This pilot study included anonymized data extracted from the electronic medical records and diagnostic images from routine diagnostic evaluations of 59 dogs. Following several optimization steps, the final model had a high accuracy (91.57%), precision (0.9286), recall (0.9070), F1 score (0.9176), and AUC-ROC (0.9529). This model was highly sensitive and specific for the detection of ultrasonographic features associated with clinicopathologic and/or histological lesions consistent with a PLE diagnosis. Combining sonographic diagnostics with machine learning yielded a high degree of accuracy in PLE differentiation. The results of this study underscore the potential of integrating an AI-based model into CIE diagnostics and PLE differentiation in clinical canine gastroenterology."}, "authors": [{"id": "2403770423", "name": "Anne-Kathrin Reichert"}, {"id": "2404426783", "name": "Kariem Ali"}, {"id": "2403735119", "name": "Amna Asif"}, {"id": "2310051346", "name": "Romy M.

Conducted within the I-Tools To Design And Enhance Access To Justice (IDEA) project, it draws on a comparative survey across six Member States—Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Italy, and Lithuania—to identify best practices in digitalized court systems. The findings point to uneven digital maturity: Estonia and Lithuania lead in digital development (8.4/10; 8.0/10) and show more favorable attitudes toward predictive justice (6.0/10; 5.8/10); whereas Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, and Italy, despite having digital tools, struggle to integrate them into routine legal workflows, reinforcing greater resistance to predictive justice. Although digital justice can improve access and efficiency, concerns persist around fairness, judicial trust, and ethical safeguards. Progress, the study suggests, depends on participatory governance, clear regulation, and the careful integration of technology into procedural frameworks. Building on these insights, the current phase of IDEA positions AI as a regulatory instrument that structures access to justice and guides user behavior. The consortium is developing a legal chatbot to guide workers and employers toward the most suitable resolution pathway—negotiation, mediation, or litigation—based on context, cost, and procedural guarantees. The chatbot tailors its responses in accordance with prevailing legal trends and the reasoning behind case law. A pilot in three Member States (MSs) will test its potential to enhance transparency, empower users, and promote proportional, informed dispute resolution within European labor justice. Against this backdrop, the chapter conceptualizes AI—operating through structured information, triage, and explainability—as a regulatory instrument that can steer behavior ex ante and support compliance ex post in redundancy disputes, complementing adjudication without displacing judicial authority."}, "authors": [{"id": "2407931341", "name": "Marianna Molinari"}, {"id": "2407929351", "name": "Marco Giacalone"}], "fields_of_study": null}

However, training accurate models on real-field data remains challenging due to over fitting and limited generalization. As observed in prior studies, traditional CNNs often struggle with real-environment variability, and transfer learning can lead to instability in training on domain-specific leaf datasets. This study focuses on detecting dome galls, a disease in Cordia dichotoma, by formulating a binary classification task (healthy vs. diseased leaves) using a custom dataset of 3,900 leaf images collected from real field environments. Methods Initially, both custom CNNs and transfer learning models were trained and compared. Among them, a modified ResNet-50 architecture showed promising results but suffered from over fitting and unstable convergence. To address this, the final sigmoid activation layer was replaced with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), and L2 regularization was applied to reduce over fitting. This hybrid DeepSVM architecture stabilized training and improved model robustness. Image preprocessing and augmentation techniques were applied to increase variability and prevent over fitting. Results The final model was evaluated on a separate test set of 400 images, and the results remained stable across repeated runs. DeepSVM achieved an accuracy of 94.50% and an F1-score of 94.47%, outperforming other well-known models like VGG-16, InceptionResNetv2, and MobileNet-V2. Conclusion These results indicate that the proposed DeepSVM approach offers better generalization and training stability than conventional CNN classifiers, potentially aiding in automated disease monitoring for precision agriculture."}, "authors": [{"id": "2339637827", "name": "Said Khalid Shah"}, {"id": "40793322", "name": "M.

Traditional treatment involves radiographic imaging that relies heavily on radiologists manually analyzing images. There have been efforts to develop computer-aided diagnosis tools that employ artificial intelligence and deep learning approaches. Existing literature focuses on developing tools that only detect and classify bone fractures, rather than addressing the broader issue of bone fracture management. However, evidence of scholarly works that include treatment recommendations is still lacking. Furthermore, deep learning-based object detectors that achieve state-of-the-art results are computationally expensive and considered as black-box solutions. Developing countries, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, face a shortage of radiologists and orthopedists. For this reason, this paper proposes a methodological approach that uses a more efficient object detection model to diagnose long bone fractures and provide prescription recommendations. An enhanced anchoring process, known as adaptive anchoring, is proposed to improve the performance of the Regional Proposal Network and the object detection model. A Faster R-CNN model with ResNet-50/101 and ResNext-50/101 backbones was used to develop an object detection model that uses X-ray images as input. To understand and interpret the model’s decision, a Gradient-based Class Activation Mapping method was used to assess the model’s learnability. The results indicate that the proposed adaptive anchoring approach can improve computational efficiency, reducing training time by up to 29% compared to the traditional approach. Model accuracy during training and validation ranged between 94% and 98%. Overall, adaptive anchoring performed better when applied with the ResNet-101 backbone, yielding an Average Precision of 92.73%, an F1 score of 96.01%, a precision of 96.80%, and a recall of 95.23%. The study provides valuable insights into the use of computationally efficient deep learning models for medical recommendation systems. Future studies should develop models to diagnose fractures using input images from various modalities and to provide prescription recommendations."}, "authors": [{"id": "2237275244", "name": "Daudi Mashauri Migayo"}, {"id": "2213156", "name": "S.

By combining large-scale, heterogeneous datasets, including electronic health records, genomic profiles, wearable device outputs, environmental measures, and social determinants of health, AI systems can identify complex relationships, reveal hidden risk factors, and forecast health outcomes with unprecedented accuracy. These capabilities enhance early detection of epidemics, support individualized care planning, and inform policies aimed at reducing health disparities. Machine learning and deep learning techniques allow healthcare systems to manage resources more efficiently, predict service demand, and optimize allocation during both routine operations and public health emergencies. Applications extend to chronic disease prevention and management, precision public health initiatives, and policy simulations that model the potential impact of interventions such as vaccination strategies, environmental regulations, or taxation policies. Despite their promise, the integration of AI and big data into population health research presents significant challenges. These include safeguarding data privacy, ensuring cybersecurity, mitigating algorithmic bias, overcoming interoperability barriers, and addressing ethical concerns related to transparency and accountability. Effective use of these technologies requires interdisciplinary collaboration among data scientists, healthcare professionals, policymakers, and ethicists. This paper critically examines the roles, benefits, and limitations of AI and big data in advancing population health research. It highlights case studies demonstrating improved health outcomes and operational efficiencies, while also outlining frameworks for ethical governance and equitable implementation. By addressing current challenges, AI and big data hold the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, promote health equity, and enhance population-level well-being on a global scale.\n "}, "authors": [{"id": "2407581879", "name": "Nnaemeka Daniel Chukwuemelie"}, {"id": "2319726444", "name": "Mubaraq Yussuf"}, {"id": "2312931199", "name": "Sulaimon Olajuwon Abdul"}], "fields_of_study": null}

The main goal is to explore how AI methods can improve resource allocation, power control, interference management, traffic prediction, and mobility management in diverse and changing wireless environments. The study seeks to provide a clear understanding of how different AI approaches work and how they fit into developing network structures. The methodology includes a thorough review and analysis of AI techniques like supervised and unsupervised machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithms, and hybrid models. This research examines these methods based on their principles, strengths, and real-world applications for optimizing wireless networks. It combines findings from various case studies and experimental results to show AI's role in improving network adaptability and efficiency. Key findings show that AI-driven optimization significantly surpasses traditional heuristic and static methods because it enables real-time, data-driven decision-making. This leads to better network throughput, lower latency, improved energy efficiency, and more effective interference management. AI techniques, especially reinforcement learning and deep learning, support adaptive resource management, predictive traffic handling, and smooth mobility in ultra-dense and multi-tier networks. The impact of this research shows how AI can transform wireless networks into intelligent, scalable, and sustainable systems that can support new applications like autonomous systems, smart cities, and immersive multimedia.

However, existing segmentation models suffer from inaccurate segmentation, slow processing, and large model size that limit their deployment on resource-constrained devices. To this end, we propose a lightweight model called Efficient Memory Aggregation U-shaped Network (EMAUnet) for human segmentation in video, which is based on a traditional U-shaped network and attention mechanism. In EMAUnet, memory modules are combined with segmentation modules, enabling end-to-end learning of semantic extraction patterns for human images. Mobile-inverse bottleneck convolution (MBConv) is used as the network backbone that has relatively few parameters and computational complexity. Inverted sub-pixel down-sampling (ISP) is proposed to minimize information loss and achieve detail-preserving of segmentation. Coordinate attention (CA) is adopted to precisely locate the portrait area. Moreover, bidirectional memory update (BMU) and memory update trigger (MUT) are proposed to improve memory resource utilization and reduce unnecessary computation. Experimental results show that, compared with the classic model ISNet, EMAUnet has the mIoU, FPS and pixel accuracy increased by 2.3%, 25.0% and 1.8%, respectively, while the amount of parameters and the size of model decreased by 33.3% and 45.7%, respectively."}, "authors": [{"id": "2356048149", "name": "Xiaoyao Zhang"}, {"id": "2277694734", "name": "Lan Yao"}, {"id": "2054265310", "name": "Feng Zeng"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Traditional solutions have largely failed to address these issues simultaneously, often relying on fragmented manual processes or static chatbots that lack real-time capabilities. This paper presents a unified Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform designed to address these distinct problems using a novel ”Hybrid AI” architecture. A ”Two-Brain” system is proposed that integrates Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for static, knowledge-intensive customer queries and Tool-Using Large Language Model (LLM) Agents for dynamic, real-time logistical support. By leveraging open source technologies, specifically Django for the backend framework and PostgreSQL with pgvector for high-dimensional vector storage, and implementing semantic caching, a cost-effective, maintainable solution is demonstrated for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in developing economies. The design mitigates hallucination risks through strict context faithfulness protocols and ensures data sovereignty via a self-hosted infrastructure. Performance metrics regarding average latency, token cost efficiency, and data freshness are analyzed, showing that the dual-pathway approach significantly optimizes resource usage compared to traditional methods. Specifically, the semantic caching mechanism reduces API costs by approximately 60 percent for repetitive queries, while the real-time agent ensures critical safety data is retrieved with a freshness of under 10 seconds. This study concludes that such a hybrid architecture provides a scalable, safe, and economically viable model for modernizing tourism operations in low-resource environments."}, "authors": [{"id": "2408117641", "name": "Aashish Dhakal"}, {"id": "2088992323", "name": "Bibek Ropakheti"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Even more with the current rise of Artificial Intelligence, what has led to the creation of different new tools aiming to improve the learning experience. This fact has contributed to the creation of systems that aim to adapt the learning process to each individual learner and offer them a personalised experience. The problem of letting automated systems manage the whole learning process is the lack of human factor, but learning objectives and teacher criteria are crucial. That is why this research proposes a solution that combines the potential of AI without neglecting the teacher decision. Concretely, the proposal is an AI model that selects the most suitable activity to each learner. To do so, this proposed model is structured in two phases. The first is the prediction phase, in which the model predicts the score a learner will obtain and the time they will spend to complete an activity. Then, in the second phase, the selection of a single activity is done by means of instructional strategies. These strategies are based on the previously obtained metrics and establish the criteria to follow for selecting activities. The selected strategy is always set by the teacher, who will guide the learners through the process. With this model, this research proposes a combination of AI techniques with human decision-making. Instead of relying the learning process to an automated engine, it includes the teacher as the one to guide the AI by making the last decision."}, "authors": [{"id": "1397303137", "name": "Alberto Real-Fernández"}, {"id": "2220836224", "name": "Javier García-Sigüenza"}, {"id": "1397303114", "name": "F.

However, traditional AI platforms tend to be black-box, so interpretability is usually limited, and it allows biases to exist that compromise trust and undermine managerial control. To overcome these issues, the present paper introduces a proposal of an explainable artificial intelligence-based decision support system to improve fairness, reliability, and policy compliance in the workflow of social-benefit distribution. Its approach combines interpretable prediction modelling, equity-sensitive modifications, uncertainty estimation, and human-in-the-loop oversight and places it into one pipeline. Quantitative analysis of synthetic and real-world welfare data demonstrates that the proposed structure removes demographic bias by 22.7% and decision under perturbations by 18.4 and greater explanation fidelity by 31.2 than non-explainable bases do. The system further enhances the consistency of the allocation by 17.5% and reduces the risk of policy-violation by 14.9 %, and at the same time, it sustains the competitive predictive accuracy. As experimental findings indicate, there might be not only the higher quality of generated balance and credible recommendations of benefits but the enhanced managerial control due to the transparency of decision rationales and audit-traceable procedures. The results emphasize the usefulness of explainable and decision-aware AI systems in facilitating socially responsible and accountable decision making towards the administration of the public good."}, "authors": [{"id": "2279599955", "name": "Shakun Garg"}, {"id": "2353561993", "name": "Amit Verma"}], "fields_of_study": null}

However, these methods typically generate complex, at best semi-structured, and often metaphorical data that are challenging to analyse consistently at a scale. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly in automated image segmentation and optical character recognition, offer new possibilities for assisting qualitative researchers in analysing and interpreting projective data of non-trivial complexity. Artificial intelligence-driven segmentation facilitates the identification of visual elements within drawings while character recognition enables the extraction of textual elements from handwritten materials. By automating these key aspects of the data processing, artificial intelligence may augment human analysis and enhance the scalability, consistency, and objectivity of projective techniques. This article explores the integration of artificial intelligence in qualitative health research, employing the concrete case of a drawing-based projective technique for elucidating the self-rated importance of health-related resources in illness prevention interventions."}, "authors": [{"id": "2348042268", "name": "S.

The findings reveal that traditional fraud patterns such as member collusion, embezzlement, and asset misappropriation coexist with emerging digital fraud such as mobile payment fraud, phishing, card fraud, and cryptocurrency scams. While rule-based and audit-based detection remain ineffective, machine learning has demonstrated significant promise for real-time detection but faces challenges related to class imbalance, interpretability, and data privacy.

However, the practical implementation of ML in critical real-world applications remains constrained due to the concerns on building reliable ML model. To address this challenge, ensuring model reliability requires a focus on three major aspects: credibility, adaptability, and interpretability. To achieve these objectives in a unified way, a new reliable learning pattern which consists of training, adaptation, testing, and second decision stage was proposed to extend the traditional training-testing pattern. Based on this framework, a new evidential reasoning rule learning (ER2L) strategy was developed, where individual-reliability is defined to tune the trained model for fitting the test sample better in adaptation stage and overall-reliability is introduced to measure the credibility of the model outputs for the second decision. Furthermore, due to ER2's nature as a probabilistic inference engine, the model is interpretable. Building on ER2L, a new ML approach termed Naïve ER2 (NER2) was proposed. The experimental studies demonstrated that NER2 can obtain better performance by introducing individual-reliability for model tuning, whilst the overall-reliability can evaluate the credibility of model output reasonably."}, "authors": [{"id": "2293266316", "name": "Zhiguo Zhou"}, {"id": "2348453319", "name": "Hui Liu"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Understanding the mechanisms through which artificial intelligence acceptance affects job crafting is critical for optimizing workforce adaptation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis longitudinal study employed a three-wave cross-lagged panel design. A total of 598 nurses from six tertiary hospitals in China completed surveys on artificial intelligence acceptance, decent work perception, and job crafting over a six-month period.

We prove that surrogate rewards exhibit Balanced Gradient Attribution, while SFT and KL penalties exhibit Unbalanced Gradient Attribution, with length-weighting creating asymmetric regularization that constrains $\\pi_{sample}$ while leaving $\\pi_{d}$ under-optimized, providing an theoretical explanation of why RL succeeds where SFT fails. We also empirically validate our theoretical predictions on arithmetic reasoning demonstrates that RL's superior generalization stems primarily from improved decision-making ($\\pi_{d}$) rather than sampling capabilities, providing a first-principles mechanistic explanation for self-correction in thinking models."}, "authors": [{"id": "2313184358", "name": "Zibo Zhao"}, {"id": "2383163968", "name": "Yuanting Zha"}, {"id": "2402844242", "name": "Haipeng Zhang"}, {"id": "2402725170", "name": "Xingcheng Xu Arizona State University"}, {"id": "2205656706", "name": "ShanghaiTech University"}, {"id": "2402726729", "name": "Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory"}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science"]}

The present paper addresses the introduction of DropShipment business models against the backdrop of the associated process automation. Process automation plays a critical role in ensuring fast and efficient process execution at high order volumes. Consequently, the introduction of dropshipping also places extensive demands on the automation of business processes. While full process automation is technically feasible, it is subject to practical limitations. To this end, the dropshipping business model is analyzed in this paper with a focus on the technical implementation of automated business processes. The areas of action necessary for the implementation of automated dropshipping processes are analyzed. The analysis is based on a survey that examines the overall importance of the business model, the contribution of key action areas to developing integration solutions supporting automated processes, and future IT requirements. In the course of the survey, 19 to 21 dual Bachelor students in Computer Science and Business Informatics were asked for their assessments. The majority of respondents have no prior knowledge of DropShipping, so the survey results primarily reflect their spontaneous assessments after receiving an introduction to the topic. The study concludes that the DropShipping business model will gain increasing importance in the future. Furthermore, it became evident that requirements analysis, in particular, represents a significant effort while offering high value in developing integration solutions for automated process handling. The data analysis shows that the cost-benefit potential of using artificial intelligence methods to enable automated processes is optimal. Finally, it was found that creating automated DropShipping processes requires, to a particularly high degree, the expertise of software developers."}, "authors": [{"id": "2405968958", "name": "David Kuhlen"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Most existing approaches are domain-specific and struggle to generalize across diverse plant organs or varying image qualities. To address this challenge, we propose a novel domain-independent classification framework that integrates quality-metric features—Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)—with an adapted lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is the first approach that explores quality measures as features for addressing challenges of classification of fruits and leaves infected by virus, fungus, and bacteria. The method first performs connected-component analysis on K-means clusters generated from R, G, B, and Gray channels to isolate disease-relevant regions and extract quality-based features. These features are fused with visual features extracted from the RGB images using a multimodal CNN architecture. Extensive experiments conducted on the proposed fruit–leaf dataset and four external benchmark datasets demonstrate that the model achieves high accuracy, strong robustness to blur, noise, rotation, and scaling, and superior generalization performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. Cross-domain evaluations further confirm that the proposed method is domain-independent and reliable for the classification of fruits and leaves infected by bacteria, fungi, and viruses.\n \nReceived: 24 September 2025 | Revised: 2 December 2025 | Accepted: 25 December 2025\n \nConflicts of Interest\nPalaiahnakote Shivakumara is the Editor-in-Chief for Artificial Intelligence and Applications, and he is not involved in the editorial review or the decision to publish this article.

They can be deployed across diverse applications, including traffic monitoring, disaster response, environmental monitoring, and numerous other domains. However, this integration introduces novel security challenges that must be addressed to ensure safe and trustworthy urban operations. This paper provides a structured, evidence-based synthesis of UAV applications in smart cities and their associated security challenges as reported in the literature over the last decade, with particular emphasis on developments from 2019 to 2025. We categorize these challenges into two primary classes: 1) cyber-attacks targeting the communication infrastructure of UAVs and 2) unwanted or unauthorized physical intrusions by UAVs themselves. We examine the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in developing intrusion detection mechanisms to mitigate these security threats. We analyze how AI-based methods, such as machine/deep learning for anomaly detection and computer vision for object recognition, can play a pivotal role in enhancing UAV security through unified detection systems that address both cyber and physical threats. Furthermore, we consolidate publicly available UAV datasets across network traffic and vision modalities suitable for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) development and evaluation. The paper concludes by identifying ten key research directions, including scalability, robustness, explainability, data scarcity, automation, hybrid detection, large language models, multimodal approaches, federated learning, and privacy preservation.

To address this, we propose an LLM-based MambaFormer hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for efficient medical question-answering (QA) and clinical assistance. The MambaFormer employs a lightweight gating mechanism that performs token-level dynamic routing to a customized Transformer expert (ET5) for short, complex queries or to a State Space Model expert (EMamba) for long, high-throughput sequences. The customized EMamba and ET5 models are tailored to accommodate input sequence dimensionality, embedding structure, sequence length, and target-specific output heads, and are fine-tuned through transfer learning on a new, custom-designed DentalQA dataset. Moreover, intelligent routing decisions are driven by the contextual complexity of token embeddings, normalized sequence length, and domain-aware features, thereby enforcing a Pareto-optimal trade-off between inference latency and prediction accuracy. Furthermore, a novel utility-guided multi-objective loss jointly optimizes decisions, router parameters, routing behavior, expert utilization, and computational cost by adaptively regulating token-level expert activation. Finally, the proposed MambaFormer is cross-validated (holdout) for medical QA on the new, custom-designed DentalQA and PubMedQA datasets and compared with state-of-the-art techniques.

In the RSwinV2 method, a hierarchical structure of the transformer has been customized based on the input dimensionality, embedding structure, and output targeted by the method. In this RSwinV2 approach, the input image has been split into non-overlapping patches and processed using shifted windows and attention in these patches. This process has helped the method link all the windows efficiently by avoiding the locality issues of non-overlapping regions in attention, while being computationally efficient. RSwinV2 has further developed based on SwinTransformer and has included patch and position embeddings to take advantage of the transformer global-linking capability by employing multi-head attention in these embeddings. Furthermore, RSwinV2 has developed and incorporated the Inverse Residual Block (IRB) into this method, which utilizes convolutional skip connections with these inclusive designs to address the vanishing gradient issues during processing. RSwinV2 inclusion of IRB has therefore facilitated this method to link global patterns as well as local patterns; hence, its integrity has helped improve lesion classification capability by minimizing variability of Mpox and increasing differences of Mpox, chickenpox, measles, and cowpox. In testing SwinV2, its accuracy of 96.51 and an F1score of 96.13 have been achieved on the Kaggle public dataset, which has outperformed standard CNN models and SwinTransformers; the RSwinV2 vector has thus proved its validity as a computer-assisted tool for Mpox lesion observation interpretation."}, "authors": [{"id": "2267339416", "name": "Rashid Iqbal"}, {"id": "2397487912", "name": "Saddam Hussain Khan Artificial Intelligence Lab"}, {"id": "2264923335", "name": "Department of Chemical Engineering"}, {"id": "2267334448", "name": "University of Engineering"}, {"id": "88668084", "name": "A.

However, empirical research increasingly demonstrates learning, memory, adaptive behavior, and goal-directed regulation across a wide range of living systems, including single cells, tissues, and organisms without brains. This paper proposes a unifying framework in which cognition is understood as an organizational property of living systems, grounded in information embodied in their physical structures and in their ongoing interactions with the environment. Within this info-computational (ICON) perspective, living systems engage in behavior, learning, and anticipation by dynamically transforming embodied information through distributed, physically realized processes that support viability and self-maintenance. These processes are present from the onset of life and become progressively more integrated and temporally extended with increasing biological organization. The framework provides explanatory continuity across biological scales and clarifies how complex forms of cognition, awareness, and mind arise as elaborations of basic life-regulatory dynamics. It generates empirically grounded, testable implications for basal cognition, developmental biology, and embodied artificial systems, in the domains such as morphogenetic regulation, bioelectric control, and embodied physical architectures where its implications can be tested."}, "authors": [{"id": "1403731773", "name": "G.

It aimed to synthesize evidence on orthographic anomalies, error patterns, and variation in English to Arabic and Arabic to English transliteration across social media, shop names, and linguistic landscapes. The fourteen studies share a unified methodological framework and provide quantitative data (percentages, frequencies, and error rates) that allow for statistical aggregation. The fourteen studies were categorized into 3 clusters: Shop names and linguistic landscapes, personal names, borrowed nouns, and ai generated transliteration. Results of the SR/MA revealed consistent patterns of inaccuracy and variation across human Arabic–English transliteration. In public signage, recurrent issues include vowel omission, inconsistent representation of consonants with no direct English equivalents, semantic and syntactic anomalies in compound names, and wide divergence from standard spellings. Personal names show similarly unstable patterns, with multiple transliterations for the same name, inconsistent rendering of the glottal stop and pharyngeal fricatives, variable spelling of the definite article /al /, and frequent gemination errors. Borrowed English nouns display phonological adaptation patterns shaped by Arabic orthography, especially in the representation of /g/ and other non native phonemes by Artificial Intelligence. Meta analytic pooling across studies shows high overall error rates, cross context variation, and tendencies toward under representation of vowels and over regularization of consonants. Subgroup analyses indicate that transliteration accuracy varies by domain, with signage showing the highest error density and personal names the greatest internal variability. Together, the findings demonstrate that human transliteration is shaped by sociolinguistic preference, orthographic habit, and contextual constraints rather than by standardized rules, establishing a coherent empirical profile of real world Arabic–English transliteration behavior. These results offer the first coherent map of human transliteration behavior and lay the groundwork for future research."}, "authors": [{"id": "2314612917", "name": "Reima Al-Jarf"}], "fields_of_study": null}

In addition, the different frameworks used to generate CYDEC are reviewed, presenting a more comprehensive one. Existing solutions in the literature using CYDEC, both without Artificial Intelligence (AI) and with AI, are studied and compared. Finally, the most salient trends of the current state of the art are discussed, offering a list of pending challenges for future research."}, "authors": [{"id": "2368878148", "name": "Pedro Beltrán-López"}, {"id": "48909688", "name": "M.

However, the rapid increase of scholarly literature in medical education poses a major challenge. Knowledge syntheses (aka reviews), which contextualize and integrate information into a single resource, have become essential tools for navigating this information overload. This article presents an overview of knowledge synthesis in medical education, starting by defining it and providing an overview of the general steps. It then examines four key types of syntheses: systematic reviews, scoping reviews, meta-reviews, and realist reviews, providing examples of each type and, when possible, pointing to reporting guidelines and resources for conducting the type. The article then addresses common methodological pitfalls, including inadequate time planning, limited collaboration with end-users, insufficiently actionable findings, and narrow search strategies. The article concludes by presenting emerging innovations, such as artificial intelligence-supported methodologies, living reviews, and alternative knowledge translation activities."}, "authors": [{"id": "2383045000", "name": "Lauren A.

We argue: a lot, but surprisingly few details matter. We point to simple biological details -- e.g. nonnegative firing and energetic/space budgets in connectionist architectures -- which, when mixed with the requirements of solving a task, produce models that predict brain responses down to single-neuron tuning. We understand this as details constraining the set of plausible algorithms, and their implementations, such that only `brain-like'algorithms are learned. In particular, each biological detail breaks a symmetry in connectionist models (scale, rotation, permutation) leading to interpretable single-neuron responses that are meaningfully characteristic of particular algorithms. This view helps us not only understand the brain's choice of algorithm but also infer algorithm from measured neural responses. Further, this perspective aligns computational neuroscience with mechanistic interpretability in AI, suggesting a more unified approach to studying the mechanisms of intelligence, both natural and artificial."}, "authors": [{"id": "10404398", "name": "James C.
