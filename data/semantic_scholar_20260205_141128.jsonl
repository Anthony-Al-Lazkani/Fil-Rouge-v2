Premised on a narrative and framework for assessing AI identified from a preliminary analysis, the scope of the study was limited to the application and effects of AI in administration, instruction, and learning. A qualitative research approach, leveraging the use of literature review as a research design and approach was used and effectively facilitated the realization of the study purpose. Artificial intelligence is a field of study and the resulting innovations and developments that have culminated in computers, machines, and other artifacts having human-like intelligence characterized by cognitive abilities, learning, adaptability, and decision-making capabilities. The study ascertained that AI has extensively been adopted and used in education, particularly by education institutions, in different forms. AI initially took the form of computer and computer related technologies, transitioning to web-based and online intelligent education systems, and ultimately with the use of embedded computer systems, together with other technologies, the use of humanoid robots and web-based chatbots to perform instructors’ duties and functions independently or with instructors. Using these platforms, instructors have been able to perform different administrative functions, such as reviewing and grading students’ assignments more effectively and efficiently, and achieve higher quality in their teaching activities. On the other hand, because the systems leverage machine learning and adaptability, curriculum and content has been customized and personalized in line with students’ needs, which has fostered uptake and retention, thereby improving learners experience and overall quality of learning."}, "authors": [{"id": "1669767608", "name": "Lijia Chen"}, {"id": "47978704", "name": "Pingping Chen"}, {"id": "144264986", "name": "Zhijian Lin"}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science"]}

Even though AI-driven systems have been shown to outperform humans in certain analytical tasks, the lack of explainability continues to spark criticism. Yet, explainability is not a purely technological issue, instead it invokes a host of medical, legal, ethical, and societal questions that require thorough exploration. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the role of explainability in medical AI and makes an ethical evaluation of what explainability means for the adoption of AI-driven tools into clinical practice. Methods Taking AI-based clinical decision support systems as a case in point, we adopted a multidisciplinary approach to analyze the relevance of explainability for medical AI from the technological, legal, medical, and patient perspectives. Drawing on the findings of this conceptual analysis, we then conducted an ethical assessment using the “Principles of Biomedical Ethics” by Beauchamp and Childress (autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice) as an analytical framework to determine the need for explainability in medical AI. Results Each of the domains highlights a different set of core considerations and values that are relevant for understanding the role of explainability in clinical practice. From the technological point of view, explainability has to be considered both in terms how it can be achieved and what is beneficial from a development perspective. When looking at the legal perspective we identified informed consent, certification and approval as medical devices, and liability as core touchpoints for explainability. Both the medical and patient perspectives emphasize the importance of considering the interplay between human actors and medical AI. We conclude that omitting explainability in clinical decision support systems poses a threat to core ethical values in medicine and may have detrimental consequences for individual and public health. Conclusions To ensure that medical AI lives up to its promises, there is a need to sensitize developers, healthcare professionals, and legislators to the challenges and limitations of opaque algorithms in medical AI and to foster multidisciplinary collaboration moving forward."}, "authors": [{"id": "33462456", "name": "J.

It is desirable to develop automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 using chest CT. Purpose To develop a fully automatic framework to detect COVID-19 using chest CT and evaluate its performances. Materials and Methods In this retrospective and multi-center study, a deep learning model, COVID-19 detection neural network (COVNet), was developed to extract visual features from volumetric chest CT exams for the detection of COVID-19. Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other non-pneumonia CT exams were included to test the robustness of the model. The datasets were collected from 6 hospitals between August 2016 and February 2020. Diagnostic performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. Results The collected dataset consisted of 4356 chest CT exams from 3,322 patients. The average age is 49±15 years and there were slightly more male patients than female (1838 vs 1484; p-value=0.29). The per-exam sensitivity and specificity for detecting COVID-19 in the independent test set was 114 of 127 (90% [95% CI: 83%, 94%]) and 294 of 307 (96% [95% CI: 93%, 98%]), respectively, with an AUC of 0.96 (p-value<0.001).

We hereby review the rapid responses in the community of medical imaging (empowered by AI) toward COVID-19. For example, AI-empowered image acquisition can significantly help automate the scanning procedure and also reshape the workflow with minimal contact to patients, providing the best protection to the imaging technicians. Also, AI can improve work efficiency by accurate delineation of infections in X-ray and CT images, facilitating subsequent quantification. Moreover, the computer-aided platforms help radiologists make clinical decisions, i.e., for disease diagnosis, tracking, and prognosis. In this review paper, we thus cover the entire pipeline of medical imaging and analysis techniques involved with COVID-19, including image acquisition, segmentation, diagnosis, and follow-up.

This study was conducted using a four-step sequential approach: (1) analysis of AI and AI concepts/technologies; (2) in-depth exploration of case studies from a great number of industrial sectors; (3) data collection from the databases (websites) of AI-based solution providers; and (4) a review of AI literature to identify their impact on the performance of organizations while highlighting the business value of AI-enabled projects transformation within organizations.Design/methodology/approachThis study has called on the theory of IT capabilities to seize the influence of AI business value on firm performance (at the organizational and process levels). The research process (responding to the research question, making discussions, interpretations and comparisons, and formulating recommendations) was based on a review of 500 case studies from IBM, AWS, Cloudera, Nvidia, Conversica, Universal Robots websites, etc. Studying the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and more specifically, of the business value of such organizations’ AI-enabled transformation projects, required us to make an archival data analysis following the three steps, namely the conceptual phase, the refinement and development phase, and the assessment phase.FindingsAI covers a wide range of technologies, including machine translation, chatbots and self-learning algorithms, all of which can allow individuals to better understand their environment and act accordingly. Organizations have been adopting AI technological innovations with a view to adapting to or disrupting their ecosystem while developing and optimizing their strategic and competitive advantages. AI fully expresses its potential through its ability to optimize existing processes and improve automation, information and transformation effects, but also to detect, predict and interact with humans. Thus, the results of our study have highlighted such AI benefits in organizations, and more specifically, its ability to improve on performance at both the organizational (financial, marketing and administrative) and process levels. By building on these AI attributes, organizations can, therefore, enhance the business value of their transformed projects. The same results also showed that organizations achieve performance through AI capabilities only when they use their features/technologies to reconfigure their processes.Research limitations/implicationsAI obviously influences the way businesses are done today. Therefore, practitioners and researchers need to consider AI as a valuable support or even a pilot for a new business model. For the purpose of our study, we adopted a research framework geared toward a more inclusive and comprehensive approach so as to better account for the intangible benefits of AI within organizations. In terms of interest, this study nurtures a scientific interest, which aims at proposing a model for analyzing the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and at the same time, filling the associated gap in the literature. As for the managerial interest, our study aims to provide managers with elements to be reconfigured or added in order to take advantage of the full benefits of AI, and therefore improve organizations’ performance, the profitability of their investments in AI transformation projects, and some competitive advantage. This study also allows managers to consider AI not as a single technology but as a set/combination of several different configurations of IT in the various company’s business areas because multiple key elements must be brought together to ensure the success of AI: data, talent mix, domain knowledge, key decisions, external partnerships and scalable infrastructure.Originality/valueThis article analyses case studies on the reuse of secondary data from AI deployment reports in organizations. The transformation of projects based on the use of AI focuses mainly on business process innovations and indirectly on those occurring at the organizational level. Thus, 500 case studies are being examined to provide significant and tangible evidence about the business value of AI-based projects and the impact of AI on firm performance. More specifically, this article, through these case studies, exposes the influence of AI at both the organizational and process performance levels, while considering it not as a single technology but as a set/combination of the several different configurations of IT in various industries."}, "authors": [{"id": "1749243395", "name": "Serge-Lopez Wamba-Taguimdje"}, {"id": "2749823", "name": "S.

Recent advances in Industrial Artificial Intelligence have showcased the potential of this technology to assist manufacturers in tackling the challenges associated with this digital transformation of Cyber-Physical Systems, through its data-driven predictive analytics and capacity to assist decision-making in highly complex, non-linear and often multistage environments. However, the industrial adoption of such solutions is still relatively low beyond the experimental pilot stage, as real environments provide unique and difficult challenges for which organizations are still unprepared. The aim of this paper is thus two-fold. First, a systematic review of current Industrial Artificial Intelligence literature is presented, focusing on its application in real manufacturing environments to identify the main enabling technologies and core design principles. Then, a set of key challenges and opportunities to be addressed by future research efforts are formulated along with a conceptual framework to bridge the gap between research in this field and the manufacturing industry, with the goal of promoting industrial adoption through a successful transition towards a digitized and data-driven company-wide culture. This paper is among the first to provide a clear definition and holistic view of Industrial Artificial Intelligence in the Industry 4.0 landscape, identifying and analysing its fundamental building blocks and ongoing trends.

This guidance has been instrumental in promoting transparent evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate their impact on health outcomes. The SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials–Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trial protocols evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for trial reports: CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials–Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 26 candidate items, which were consulted upon by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The SPIRIT-AI extension includes 15 new items that were considered sufficiently important for clinical trial protocols of AI interventions. These new items should be routinely reported in addition to the core SPIRIT 2013 items. SPIRIT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention will be integrated, considerations for the handling of input and output data, the human–AI interaction and analysis of error cases. SPIRIT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness for clinical trial protocols for AI interventions. Its use will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the design and risk of bias for a planned clinical trial. The CONSORT-AI and SPIRIT-AI extensions improve the transparency of clinical trial design and trial protocol reporting for artificial intelligence interventions."}, "authors": [{"id": "22447999", "name": "S.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is viewed as amongst the technological advances that will reshape modern societies and their relations. While the design and deployment of systems that continually adapt holds the promise of far-reaching positive change, they simultaneously pose significant risks, especially to already vulnerable peoples. Values and power are central to this discussion. Decolonial theories use historical hindsight to explain patterns of power that shape our intellectual, political, economic, and social world. By embedding a decolonial critical approach within its technical practice, AI communities can develop foresight and tactics that can better align research and technology development with established ethical principles, centring vulnerable peoples who continue to bear the brunt of negative impacts of innovation and scientific progress. We highlight problematic applications that are instances of coloniality, and using a decolonial lens, submit three tactics that can form a decolonial field of artificial intelligence: creating a critical technical practice of AI, seeking reverse tutelage and reverse pedagogies, and the renewal of affective and political communities. The years ahead will usher in a wave of new scientific breakthroughs and technologies driven by AI research, making it incumbent upon AI communities to strengthen the social contract through ethical foresight and the multiplicity of intellectual perspectives available to us, ultimately supporting future technologies that enable greater well-being, with the goal of beneficence and justice for all."}, "authors": [{"id": "1701708450", "name": "Shakir Mohamed"}, {"id": "1799412130", "name": "Marie-Therese Png"}, {"id": "103087275", "name": "William S.

To train our MIT Open Voice model we built a data collection pipeline of COVID-19 cough recordings through our website (opensigma.mit.edu) between April and May 2020 and created the largest audio COVID-19 cough balanced dataset reported to date with 5,320 subjects. Methods: We developed an AI speech processing framework that leverages acoustic biomarker feature extractors to pre-screen for COVID-19 from cough recordings, and provide a personalized patient saliency map to longitudinally monitor patients in real-time, non-invasively, and at essentially zero variable cost. Cough recordings are transformed with Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient and inputted into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based architecture made up of one Poisson biomarker layer and 3 pre-trained ResNet50's in parallel, outputting a binary pre-screening diagnostic. Our CNN-based models have been trained on 4256 subjects and tested on the remaining 1064 subjects of our dataset. Transfer learning was used to learn biomarker features on larger datasets, previously successfully tested in our Lab on Alzheimer's, which significantly improves the COVID-19 discrimination accuracy of our architecture. Results: When validated with subjects diagnosed using an official test, the model achieves COVID-19 sensitivity of 98.5% with a specificity of 94.2% (AUC: 0.97). For asymptomatic subjects it achieves sensitivity of 100% with a specificity of 83.2%. Conclusions: AI techniques can produce a free, non-invasive, real-time, any-time, instantly distributable, large-scale COVID-19 asymptomatic screening tool to augment current approaches in containing the spread of COVID-19. Practical use cases could be for daily screening of students, workers, and public as schools, jobs, and transport reopen, or for pool testing to quickly alert of outbreaks in groups. General speech biomarkers may exist that cover several disease categories, as we demonstrated using the same ones for COVID-19 and Alzheimer's."}, "authors": [{"id": "1631190928", "name": "Jordi Laguarta"}, {"id": "11629520", "name": "F.

A subdomain of AI is machine learning (ML), which “learns” intrinsic statistical patterns in data to eventually cast predictions on unseen data. Deep learning is a ML technique using multi-layer mathematical operations for learning and inferring on complex data like imagery. This succinct narrative review describes the application, limitations and possible future of AI-based dental diagnostics, treatment planning, and conduct, for example, image analysis, prediction making, record keeping, as well as dental research and discovery. AI-based applications will streamline care, relieving the dental workforce from laborious routine tasks, increasing health at lower costs for a broader population, and eventually facilitate personalized, predictive, preventive, and participatory dentistry. However, AI solutions have not by large entered routine dental practice, mainly due to 1) limited data availability, accessibility, structure, and comprehensiveness, 2) lacking methodological rigor and standards in their development, 3) and practical questions around the value and usefulness of these solutions, but also ethics and responsibility. Any AI application in dentistry should demonstrate tangible value by, for example, improving access to and quality of care, increasing efficiency and safety of services, empowering and enabling patients, supporting medical research, or increasing sustainability. Individual privacy, rights, and autonomy need to be put front and center; a shift from centralized to distributed/federated learning may address this while improving scalability and robustness. Lastly, trustworthiness into, and generalizability of, dental AI solutions need to be guaranteed; the implementation of continuous human oversight and standards grounded in evidence-based dentistry should be expected. Methods to visualize, interpret, and explain the logic behind AI solutions will contribute (“explainable AI”). Dental education will need to accompany the introduction of clinical AI solutions by fostering digital literacy in the future dental workforce."}, "authors": [{"id": "5747104", "name": "F.

Second, it is important to be clear about the goal of alignment. There are significant differences between AI that aligns with instructions, intentions, revealed preferences, ideal preferences, interests and values. A principle-based approach to AI alignment, which combines these elements in a systematic way, has considerable advantages in this context. Third, the central challenge for theorists is not to identify ‘true’ moral principles for AI; rather, it is to identify fair principles for alignment that receive reflective endorsement despite widespread variation in people’s moral beliefs.

This becomes particularly problematic when we attach human moral activities to AI. For example, the European Commission’s High-level Expert Group on AI (HLEG) have adopted the position that we should establish a relationship of trust with AI and should cultivate trustworthy AI (HLEG AI Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI, 2019, p. 35). Trust is one of the most important and defining activities in human relationships, so proposing that AI should be trusted, is a very serious claim. This paper will show that AI cannot be something that has the capacity to be trusted according to the most prevalent definitions of trust because it does not possess emotive states or can be held responsible for their actions—requirements of the affective and normative accounts of trust. While AI meets all of the requirements of the rational account of trust, it will be shown that this is not actually a type of trust at all, but is instead, a form of reliance. Ultimately, even complex machines such as AI should not be viewed as trustworthy as this undermines the value of interpersonal trust, anthropomorphises AI, and diverts responsibility from those developing and using them."}, "authors": [{"id": "144422064", "name": "M.

Its widespread use has been instrumental in ensuring transparency in the evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate impact on health outcomes. The CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials–Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trials evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for clinical trial protocols: SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials–Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 29 candidate items, which were assessed by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a two-day consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The CONSORT-AI extension includes 14 new items that were considered sufficiently important for AI interventions that they should be routinely reported in addition to the core CONSORT 2010 items. CONSORT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention is integrated, the handling of inputs and outputs of the AI intervention, the human–AI interaction and provision of an analysis of error cases. CONSORT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness in reporting clinical trials for AI interventions. It will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the quality of clinical trial design and risk of bias in the reported outcomes.

A brief background of AI, and specifically machine learning (ML) algorithms, is provided including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We categorize creative applications into five groups, related to how AI technologies are used: (i) content creation, (ii) information analysis, (iii) content enhancement and post production workflows, (iv) information extraction and enhancement, and (v) data compression. We critically examine the successes and limitations of this rapidly advancing technology in each of these areas. We further differentiate between the use of AI as a creative tool and its potential as a creator in its own right. We foresee that, in the near future, ML-based AI will be adopted widely as a tool or collaborative assistant for creativity. In contrast, we observe that the successes of ML in domains with fewer constraints, where AI is the ‘creator’, remain modest. The potential of AI (or its developers) to win awards for its original creations in competition with human creatives is also limited, based on contemporary technologies. We therefore conclude that, in the context of creative industries, maximum benefit from AI will be derived where its focus is human-centric—where it is designed to augment, rather than replace, human creativity."}, "authors": [{"id": "1756108", "name": "N.

This “decision making” side of innovation is what scholars and practitioners refer to as “design.” Decisions in innovation processes have so far been taken by humans. What happens when they can be substituted by machines? Artificial Intelligence (AI) brings data and algorithms to the core of the innovation processes. What are the implications of this diffusion of AI for our understanding of design and innovation? Is AI just another digital technology that, akin to many others, will not significantly question what we know about design? Or will it create transformations in design that current theoretical frameworks cannot capture? This paper proposes a framework for understanding the design and innovation in the age of AI. We discuss the implications for design and innovation theory. Specifically, we observe that, as creative problem-solving is significantly conducted by algorithms, human design increasingly becomes an activity of sensemaking, that is, understanding which problems should or could be addressed. This shift in focus calls for the new theories and brings design closer to leadership, which is, inherently, an activity of sensemaking. Our insights are derived from and illustrated with two cases at the frontier of AI—Netflix and Airbnb (com-plemented with analyses of Microsoft and Tesla)—which point to two directions for the evolution of design and innovation in firms. First, AI enables an organization to overcome many past limitations of human-intensive design processes, by improving the scalability of the process, broadening its scope across traditional boundaries, and en-hancing its ability to learn and adapt on the fly. Second, and maybe more surprising, while removing these limitations, AI also appears to deeply enact several popular design principles. AI thus reinforces the principles of Design Thinking, namely: being people-centered, abductive, and iterative. In fact, AI enables the creation of solutions that are more highly user centered than human-based approaches (i.e., to an extreme level of granularity, designed for every single person); that are potentially more creative; and that are continuously updated through learning iterations across the entire product life cycle. In sum, while AI does not undermine the basic principles of design, it profoundly changes the practice of design. Problem-solving tasks, traditionally carried out by designers, are now automated into learning loops that operate without limitations of volume and speed. The algorithms embedded in these loops think in a radically different way than a designer who handles the complex problems holistically with a systemic perspective. Algorithms instead han-dle complexity through very simple tasks, which are iterated continuously.

Although some researchers claim that AI-based change detection approaches outperform traditional change detection approaches, it is not immediately obvious how and to what extent AI can improve the performance of change detection. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art methods, applications, and challenges of AI for change detection. Specifically, the implementation process of AI-based change detection is first introduced. Then, the data from different sensors used for change detection, including optical RS data, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, street view images, and combined heterogeneous data, are presented, and the available open datasets are also listed. The general frameworks of AI-based change detection methods are reviewed and analyzed systematically, and the unsupervised schemes used in AI-based change detection are further analyzed. Subsequently, the commonly used networks in AI for change detection are described. From a practical point of view, the application domains of AI-based change detection methods are classified based on their applicability. Finally, the major challenges and prospects of AI for change detection are discussed and delineated, including (a) heterogeneous big data processing, (b) unsupervised AI, and (c) the reliability of AI.

To achieve goal of full automation ( i.e., self-driving ( , it is important to know how AI works in AV systems. Existing research have made great efforts in investigating different aspects of applying AI in AV development. However, few studies have offered the research community a thorough examination of current practices in implementing AI in AVs. Thus, this paper aims to shorten the gap by providing a comprehensive survey of key studies in this research avenue. Specifically, it intends to analyze their use of AIs in supporting the primary applications in AVs: 1) perception; 2) localization and mapping; and 3) decision making. It investigates the current practices to understand how AI can be used and what are the challenges and issues associated with their implementation. Based on the exploration of current practices and technology advances, this paper further provides insights into potential opportunities regarding the use of AI in conjunction with other emerging technologies: 1) high definition maps, big data, and high performance computing; 2) augmented reality( AR ) / virtual reality ( VR ) enhanced simulation platform; and 3) 5G communication for connected AVs.

In recent years, applications of big data and AI in education have made significant headways. This highlights a novel trend in leading-edge educational research. The convenience and embeddedness of data collection within educational technologies, paired with computational techniques have made the analyses of big data a reality. We are moving beyond proof-of-concept demonstrations and applications of techniques, and are beginning to see substantial adoption in many areas of education. The key research trends in the domains of big data and AI are associated with assessment, individualized learning, and precision education. Model-driven data analytics approaches will grow quickly to guide the development, interpretation, and validation of the algorithms. However, conclusions from educational analytics should, of course, be applied with caution. At the education policy level, the government should be devoted to supporting lifelong learning, offering teacher education programs, and protecting personal data. With regard to the education industry, reciprocal and mutually beneficial relationships should be developed in order to enhance academia-industry collaboration. Furthermore, it is important to make sure that technologies are guided by relevant theoretical frameworks and are empirically tested. Lastly, in this paper we advocate an in-depth dialog between supporters of “cold” technology and “warm” humanity so that it can lead to greater understanding among teachers and students about how technology, and specifically, the big data explosion and AI revolution can bring new opportunities (and challenges) that can be best leveraged for pedagogical practices and learning."}, "authors": [{"id": "48803731", "name": "Hui Luan"}, {"id": "1804075", "name": "P.

However, studies have shown that, by exploiting the shared parameters adversaries can still compromise industrial applications such as auto-driving navigation systems, medical data in wearable devices, and industrial robots’ decision making. In this article, to solve this problem, we propose an efficient and privacy-enhanced federated learning (PEFL) scheme for IAI.

With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the ability of AI systems to make automated and self-learned decisions, a call for transparency of how such systems reach decisions has echoed within academic and policy circles. The term transparency, however, relates to multiple concepts, fulfills many functions, and holds different promises that struggle to be realized in concrete applications. Indeed, the complexity of transparency for ADM shows tension between transparency as a normative ideal and its translation to practical application. To address this tension, we first conduct a review of transparency, analyzing its challenges and limitations concerning automated decision-making practices. We then look at the lessons learned from the development of Privacy by Design, as a basis for developing the Transparency by Design principles. Finally, we propose a set of nine principles to cover relevant contextual, technical, informational, and stakeholder-sensitive considerations.

Automation of these tasks could free clinicians to focus on more complex work and increase the accessibility to health care services for the public. An overarching assessment of the acceptability, usability, and effectiveness of these agents in health care is needed to collate the evidence so that future development can target areas for improvement and potential for sustainable adoption. Objective This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness and usability of conversational agents in health care and identify the elements that users like and dislike to inform future research and development of these agents. Methods PubMed, Medline (Ovid), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica dataBASE), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science, and the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library were systematically searched for articles published since 2008 that evaluated unconstrained natural language processing conversational agents used in health care. EndNote (version X9, Clarivate Analytics) reference management software was used for initial screening, and full-text screening was conducted by 1 reviewer. Data were extracted, and the risk of bias was assessed by one reviewer and validated by another. Results A total of 31 studies were selected and included a variety of conversational agents, including 14 chatbots (2 of which were voice chatbots), 6 embodied conversational agents (3 of which were interactive voice response calls, virtual patients, and speech recognition screening systems), 1 contextual question-answering agent, and 1 voice recognition triage system. Overall, the evidence reported was mostly positive or mixed. Usability and satisfaction performed well (27/30 and 26/31), and positive or mixed effectiveness was found in three-quarters of the studies (23/30). However, there were several limitations of the agents highlighted in specific qualitative feedback. Conclusions The studies generally reported positive or mixed evidence for the effectiveness, usability, and satisfactoriness of the conversational agents investigated, but qualitative user perceptions were more mixed. The quality of many of the studies was limited, and improved study design and reporting are necessary to more accurately evaluate the usefulness of the agents in health care and identify key areas for improvement. Further research should also analyze the cost-effectiveness, privacy, and security of the agents.

Our starting point has been to ask, what is the nature of machine intelligence, and what are its limits and potentials in education? This paper offers some tentative answers, first conceptually, and then practically in an overview of the results of a number of experimental implementations documented in greater detail elsewhere. Our key finding is that artificial intelligence—in the context of the practices of electronic computing developing over the past three quarters of a century—will never in any sense “take over” the role of teacher, because how it works and what it does are so profoundly different from human intelligence. However, within the limits that we describe in this paper, it offers the potential to transform education in ways that—counterintuitively perhaps—make education more human, not less."}, "authors": [{"id": "33955451", "name": "B.

Interest in the use of AI for urban innovation continues to grow. Particularly, the rise of smart cities—urban locations that are enabled by community, technology, and policy to deliver productivity, innovation, livability, wellbeing, sustainability, accessibility, good governance, and good planning—has increased the demand for AI-enabled innovations. There is, nevertheless, no scholarly work that provides a comprehensive review on the topic. This paper generates insights into how AI can contribute to the development of smarter cities. A systematic review of the literature is selected as the methodologic approach. Results are categorized under the main smart city development dimensions, i.e., economy, society, environment, and governance. The findings of the systematic review containing 93 articles disclose that: (a) AI in the context of smart cities is an emerging field of research and practice. (b) The central focus of the literature is on AI technologies, algorithms, and their current and prospective applications. (c) AI applications in the context of smart cities mainly concentrate on business efficiency, data analytics, education, energy, environmental sustainability, health, land use, security, transport, and urban management areas. (d) There is limited scholarly research investigating the risks of wider AI utilization. (e) Upcoming disruptions of AI in cities and societies have not been adequately examined. Current and potential contributions of AI to the development of smarter cities are outlined in this paper to inform scholars of prospective areas for further research."}, "authors": [{"id": "3266895", "name": "Tan Yigitcanlar"}, {"id": "1697759", "name": "K.

Due to COVID-19’s spread in 212 countries and territories and increasing numbers of infected cases and death tolls mounting to 5,212,172 and 334,915 (as of May 22 2020), it remains a real threat to the public health system. This paper renders a response to combat the virus through Artificial Intelligence (AI). Some Deep Learning (DL) methods have been illustrated to reach this goal, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and Long/Short Term Memory (LSTM). It delineates an integrated bioinformatics approach in which different aspects of information from a continuum of structured and unstructured data sources are put together to form the user-friendly platforms for physicians and researchers. The main advantage of these AI-based platforms is to accelerate the process of diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 disease. The most recent related publications and medical reports were investigated with the purpose of choosing inputs and targets of the network that could facilitate reaching a reliable Artificial Neural Network-based tool for challenges associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, there are some specific inputs for each platform, including various forms of the data, such as clinical data and medical imaging which can improve the performance of the introduced approaches toward the best responses in practical applications."}, "authors": [{"id": "40559256", "name": "M.

But what, precisely, is the nature of trust in AI? What are the prerequisites and goals of the cognitive mechanism of trust, and how can we promote them, or assess whether they are being satisfied in a given interaction? This work aims to answer these questions. We discuss a model of trust inspired by, but not identical to, interpersonal trust (i.e., trust between people) as defined by sociologists. This model rests on two key properties: the vulnerability of the user; and the ability to anticipate the impact of the AI model's decisions. We incorporate a formalization of 'contractual trust', such that trust between a user and an AI model is trust that some implicit or explicit contract will hold, and a formalization of 'trustworthiness' (that detaches from the notion of trustworthiness in sociology), and with it concepts of 'warranted' and 'unwarranted' trust. We present the possible causes of warranted trust as intrinsic reasoning and extrinsic behavior, and discuss how to design trustworthy AI, how to evaluate whether trust has manifested, and whether it is warranted. Finally, we elucidate the connection between trust and XAI using our formalization."}, "authors": [{"id": "41016275", "name": "Alon Jacovi"}, {"id": "3451494", "name": "Ana Marasović"}, {"id": "144658641", "name": "Tim Miller"}, {"id": "79775260", "name": "Yoav Goldberg"}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science"]}

Among the many reasons why these problems exist, one of the most important (for which we provide a preliminary solution here) is the current lack of best practice guidance specific to machine learning and artificial intelligence.

We also examine the state of education relating to AI amongst this cohort. Methods UK medical students were invited to complete an anonymous electronic survey consisting of Likert and dichotomous questions. Results Four hundred eighty-four responses were received from 19 UK medical schools. Eighty-eight percent of students believed that AI will play an important role in healthcare, and 49% reported they were less likely to consider a career in radiology due to AI. Eighty-nine percent of students believed that teaching in AI would be beneficial for their careers, and 78% agreed that students should receive training in AI as part of their medical degree. Only 45 students received any teaching on AI; none of the students received such teaching as part of their compulsory curriculum. Statistically, students that did receive teaching in AI were more likely to consider radiology ( p  = 0.01) and rated more positively to the questions relating to the perceived competence in the post-graduation use of AI ( p  = 0.01–0.04); despite this, a large proportion of students in the taught group reported a lack of confidence and understanding required for the critical use of healthcare AI tools. Conclusions UK medical students understand the importance of AI and are keen to engage. Medical school training on AI should be expanded and improved.

To appreciate human-technology interaction in the clinical setting, augmented intelligence has been proposed as a cognitive extension of AI in health care, emphasizing its assistive and supplementary role to medical professionals. While truly autonomous medical robotic systems are still beyond reach, the virtual component of AI, known as software-type algorithms, is the main component used in dentistry. Because of their powerful capabilities in data analysis, these virtual algorithms are expected to improve the accuracy and efficacy of dental diagnosis, provide visualized anatomic guidance for treatment, simulate and evaluate prospective results, and project the occurrence and prognosis of oral diseases. Potential obstacles in contemporary algorithms that prevent routine implementation of AI include the lack of data curation, sharing, and readability; the inability to illustrate the inner decision-making process; the insufficient power of classical computing; and the neglect of ethical principles in the design of AI frameworks. It is necessary to maintain a proactive attitude toward AI to ensure its affirmative development and promote human-technology rapport to revolutionize dental practice. The present review outlines the progress and potential dental applications of AI in medical-aided diagnosis, treatment, and disease prediction and discusses their data limitations, interpretability, computing power, and ethical considerations, as well as their impact on dentists, with the objective of creating a backdrop for future research in this rapidly expanding arena."}, "authors": [{"id": "122429201", "name": "T.

Objective The purpose of this analysis is to provide a dynamic and longitudinal bibliometric analysis of health care–related AI publications. Methods The Web of Science (Clarivate PLC) was searched to retrieve all existing and highly cited AI-related health care research papers published in English up to December 2019. Based on bibliometric indicators, a search strategy was developed to screen the title for eligibility, using the abstract and full text where needed. The growth rate of publications, characteristics of research activities, publication patterns, and research hotspot tendencies were computed using the HistCite software. Results The search identified 5235 hits, of which 1473 publications were included in the analyses. Publication output increased an average of 17.02% per year since 1995, but the growth rate of research papers significantly increased to 45.15% from 2014 to 2019. The major health problems studied in AI research are cancer, depression, Alzheimer disease, heart failure, and diabetes. Artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and convolutional neural networks have the highest impact on health care. Nucleosides, convolutional neural networks, and tumor markers have remained research hotspots through 2019. Conclusions This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the AI-related research conducted in the field of health care, which helps researchers, policy makers, and practitioners better understand the development of health care–related AI research and possible practice implications.

Design Systematic review. Data sources Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization trial registry from 2010 to June 2019. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Randomised trial registrations and non-randomised studies comparing the performance of a deep learning algorithm in medical imaging with a contemporary group of one or more expert clinicians. Medical imaging has seen a growing interest in deep learning research. The main distinguishing feature of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in deep learning is that when CNNs are fed with raw data, they develop their own representations needed for pattern recognition. The algorithm learns for itself the features of an image that are important for classification rather than being told by humans which features to use. The selected studies aimed to use medical imaging for predicting absolute risk of existing disease or classification into diagnostic groups (eg, disease or non-disease). For example, raw chest radiographs tagged with a label such as pneumothorax or no pneumothorax and the CNN learning which pixel patterns suggest pneumothorax. Review methods Adherence to reporting standards was assessed by using CONSORT (consolidated standards of reporting trials) for randomised studies and TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) for non-randomised studies. Risk of bias was assessed by using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised studies and PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool) for non-randomised studies. Results Only 10 records were found for deep learning randomised clinical trials, two of which have been published (with low risk of bias, except for lack of blinding, and high adherence to reporting standards) and eight are ongoing. Of 81 non-randomised clinical trials identified, only nine were prospective and just six were tested in a real world clinical setting. The median number of experts in the comparator group was only four (interquartile range 2-9). Full access to all datasets and code was severely limited (unavailable in 95% and 93% of studies, respectively). The overall risk of bias was high in 58 of 81 studies and adherence to reporting standards was suboptimal (<50% adherence for 12 of 29 TRIPOD items). 61 of 81 studies stated in their abstract that performance of artificial intelligence was at least comparable to (or better than) that of clinicians. Only 31 of 81 studies (38%) stated that further prospective studies or trials were required. Conclusions Few prospective deep learning studies and randomised trials exist in medical imaging. Most non-randomised trials are not prospective, are at high risk of bias, and deviate from existing reporting standards. Data and code availability are lacking in most studies, and human comparator groups are often small. Future studies should diminish risk of bias, enhance real world clinical relevance, improve reporting and transparency, and appropriately temper conclusions.

Identifying the best pathway to personalized and population medicine involves the ability to analyze comprehensive patient information together with broader aspects to monitor and distinguish between sick and relatively healthy people, which will lead to a better understanding of biological indicators that can signal shifts in health. While the complexities of disease at the individual level have made it difficult to utilize healthcare information in clinical decision-making, some of the existing constraints have been greatly minimized by technological advancements. To implement effective precision medicine with enhanced ability to positively impact patient outcomes and provide real-time decision support, it is important to harness the power of electronic health records by integrating disparate data sources and discovering patient-specific patterns of disease progression. Useful analytic tools, technologies, databases, and approaches are required to augment networking and interoperability of clinical, laboratory and public health systems, as well as addressing ethical and social issues related to the privacy and protection of healthcare data with effective balance. Developing multifunctional machine learning platforms for clinical data extraction, aggregation, management and analysis can support clinicians by efficiently stratifying subjects to understand specific scenarios and optimize decision-making. Implementation of artificial intelligence in healthcare is a compelling vision that has the potential in leading to the significant improvements for achieving the goals of providing real-time, better personalized and population medicine at lower costs.

In this context, the authors provide evidence of a novel “word-of-machine” effect, the phenomenon by which utilitarian/hedonic attribute trade-offs determine preference for, or resistance to, AI-based recommendations compared with traditional word of mouth, or human-based recommendations. The word-of-machine effect stems from a lay belief that AI recommenders are more competent than human recommenders in the utilitarian realm and less competent than human recommenders in the hedonic realm. As a consequence, importance or salience of utilitarian attributes determine preference for AI recommenders over human ones, and importance or salience of hedonic attributes determine resistance to AI recommenders over human ones (Studies 1–4). The word-of machine effect is robust to attribute complexity, number of options considered, and transaction costs. The word-of-machine effect reverses for utilitarian goals if a recommendation needs matching to a person’s unique preferences (Study 5) and is eliminated in the case of human–AI hybrid decision making (i.e., augmented rather than artificial intelligence; Study 6). An intervention based on the consider-the-opposite protocol attenuates the word-of-machine effect (Studies 7a–b)."}, "authors": [{"id": "83650857", "name": "Chiara Longoni"}, {"id": "113799782", "name": "Luca Cian"}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science"]}

One extensively used method to minimize the cost and time for the drug development process is computer-aided drug design (CADD). CADD allows better focusing on experiments, which can reduce the time and cost involved in researching new drugs. In this context, structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) is robust and useful and is one of the most promising in silico techniques for drug design. SBVS attempts to predict the best interaction mode between two molecules to form a stable complex, and it uses scoring functions to estimate the force of non-covalent interactions between a ligand and molecular target. Thus, scoring functions are the main reason for the success or failure of SBVS software. Many software programs are used to perform SBVS, and since they use different algorithms, it is possible to obtain different results from different software using the same input. In the last decade, a new technique of SBVS called consensus virtual screening (CVS) has been used in some studies to increase the accuracy of SBVS and to reduce the false positives obtained in these experiments. An indispensable condition to be able to utilize SBVS is the availability of a 3D structure of the target protein. Some virtual databases, such as the Protein Data Bank, have been created to store the 3D structures of molecules. However, sometimes it is not possible to experimentally obtain the 3D structure. In this situation, the homology modeling methodology allows the prediction of the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. This review presents an overview of the challenges involved in the use of CADD to perform SBVS, the areas where CADD tools support SBVS, a comparison between the most commonly used tools, and the techniques currently used in an attempt to reduce the time and cost in the drug development process. Finally, the final considerations demonstrate the importance of using SBVS in the drug development process."}, "authors": [{"id": "31552113", "name": "E. H. B. Maia"}, {"id": "24476986", "name": "L.

METHODS We developed a modified stacked auto-encoder for modeling the transmission dynamics of the epidemics. We applied this model to real-time forecasting the confirmed cases of Covid-19 across China. The data were collected from January 11 to February 27, 2020 by WHO. We used the latent variables in the auto-encoder and clustering algorithms to group the provinces/cities for investigating the transmission structure. RESULTS We forecasted curves of cumulative confirmed cases of Covid-19 across China from Jan 20, 2020 to April 20, 2020. Using the multiple-step forecasting, the estimated average errors of 6-step, 7-step, 8-step, 9-step and 10-step forecasting were 1.64%, 2.27%, 2.14%, 2.08%, 0.73%, respectively. We predicted that the time points of the provinces/cities entering the plateau of the forecasted transmission dynamic curves varied, ranging from Jan 21 to April 19, 2020. The 34 provinces/cities were grouped into 9 clusters. CONCLUSIONS The accuracy of the AI-based methods for forecasting the trajectory of Covid-19 was high. We predicted that the epidemics of Covid-19 will be over by the middle of April. If the data are reliable and there are no second transmissions, we can accurately forecast the transmission dynamics of the Covid-19 across the provinces/cities in China. The AI-inspired methods are a powerful tool for helping public health planning and policymaking."}, "authors": [{"id": "7690084", "name": "Zixin Hu"}, {"id": "1408179617", "name": "Qiyang Ge"}, {"id": "2109369777", "name": "Shudi Li"}, {"id": "2152162225", "name": "Li Jin"}, {"id": "48037380", "name": "M.

The promise of efficient, low‐cost, or “neutral” solutions harnessing the potential of big data has led public bodies to adopt algorithmic systems in the provision of public services. As AI algorithms have permeated high‐stakes aspects of our public existence—from hiring and education decisions to the governmental use of enforcement powers (policing) or liberty‐restricting decisions (bail and sentencing)—this necessarily raises important accountability questions: What accountability challenges do AI algorithmic systems bring with them, and how can we safeguard accountability in algorithmic decision‐making? Drawing on a decidedly public administration perspective, and given the current challenges that have thus far become manifest in the field, we critically reflect on and map out in a conceptually guided manner the implications of these systems, and the limitations they pose, for public accountability."}, "authors": [{"id": "3316429", "name": "M.

The need for accuracy in histopathologic diagnosis of cancer is increasing as personalized cancer therapy requires accurate biomarker assessment. The appearance of digital image analysis holds promise to improve both the volume and precision of histomorphological evaluation. Recently, machine learning, and particularly deep learning, has enabled rapid advances in computational pathology. The integration of machine learning into routine care will be a milestone for the healthcare sector in the next decade, and histopathology is right at the centre of this revolution. Examples of potential high‐value machine learning applications include both model‐based assessment of routine diagnostic features in pathology, and the ability to extract and identify novel features that provide insights into a disease. Recent groundbreaking results have demonstrated that applications of machine learning methods in pathology significantly improves metastases detection in lymph nodes, Ki67 scoring in breast cancer, Gleason grading in prostate cancer and tumour‐infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) scoring in melanoma. Furthermore, deep learning models have also been demonstrated to be able to predict status of some molecular markers in lung, prostate, gastric and colorectal cancer based on standard HE slides. Moreover, prognostic (survival outcomes) deep neural network models based on digitized HE slides have been demonstrated in several diseases, including lung cancer, melanoma and glioma. In this review, we aim to present and summarize the latest developments in digital image analysis and in the application of artificial intelligence in diagnostic pathology."}, "authors": [{"id": "7225832", "name": "B.

We proposed an artificial intelligence (AI) system for rapid COVID-19 detection and performed extensive statistical analysis of CTs of COVID-19 based on the AI system. We developed and evaluated our system on a large dataset with more than 10 thousand CT volumes from COVID-19, influenza-A/B, non-viral community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and non-pneumonia subjects. In such a difficult multi-class diagnosis task, our deep convolutional neural network-based system is able to achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 97.81% for multi-way classification on test cohort of 3,199 scans, AUC of 92.99% and 93.25% on two publicly available datasets, CC-CCII and MosMedData respectively. In a reader study involving five radiologists, the AI system outperforms all of radiologists in more challenging tasks at a speed of two orders of magnitude above them. Diagnosis performance of chest x-ray (CXR) is compared to that of CT. Detailed interpretation of deep network is also performed to relate system outputs with CT presentations. The code is available at https://github.com/ChenWWWeixiang/diagnosis_covid19. In some contexts, rapid detection of COVID-19 from CT scans can be crucial for optimal patient management.

As AI technologies are new to K-12 schools, there is a lack of studies that inform schools’ teachers about AI curriculum design. How to prepare and engage teachers, and which approaches are suitable for planning the curriculum for sustainable development, are unclear. Therefore, this case study aimed to explore the views of teachers with and without AI teaching experience on key considerations for the preparation, implementation and continuous refinement of a formal AI curriculum for K-12 schools. It drew on the self-determination theory (SDT) and four basic curriculum planning approaches—content, product, process and praxis—as theoretical frameworks to explain the research problems and findings. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 teachers—twelve with and twelve without experience in teaching AI—and used thematic analysis to analyze the interview data. Our findings revealed that genuine curriculum creation should encompass all four forms of curriculum design approach that are coordinated by teachers’ self-determination to be orchestrators of student learning experiences. This study also proposed a curriculum development cycle for teachers and curriculum officers."}, "authors": [{"id": "1703646", "name": "Thomas K. F. Chiu"}, {"id": "3225877", "name": "C.

AI with its deep learning functions and capabilities can be employed as a tool which empowers machines to solve problems that could reform urban landscapes as we have known them for decades now and help with establishing a new era; the era of the “smart city”. One of the key areas that AI can redefine is transport. Mobility provision and its impact on urban development can be significantly improved by the employment of intelligent transport systems in general and automated transport in particular. This new breed of AI-based mobility, despite its machine-orientation, has to be a user-centred technology that “understands” and “satisfies” the human user, the markets and the society as a whole. Trust should be built, and risks should be eliminated, for this transition to take off. This paper provides a novel conceptual contribution that thoroughly discusses the scarcely studied nexus of AI, transportation and the smart city and how this will affect urban futures. It specifically covers key smart mobility initiatives referring to Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), autonomous Personal and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (PAVs and UAVs) and Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS), but also interventions that may work as enabling technologies for transport, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Physical Internet (PI) or reflect broader transformations like Industry 4.0. This work is ultimately a reference tool for researchers and city planners that provides clear and systematic definitions of the ambiguous smart mobility terms of tomorrow and describes their individual and collective roles underpinning the nexus in scope."}, "authors": [{"id": "12942975", "name": "A.

AI promises enormous benefits for economic growth, social development, as well as human well-being and safety improvement. However, the low-level of explainability, data biases, data security, data privacy, and ethical problems of AI-based technology pose significant risks for users, developers, humanity, and societies. As AI advances, one critical issue is how to address the ethical and moral challenges associated with AI. Even though the concept of “machine ethics” was proposed around 2006, AI ethics is still in the infancy stage. AI ethics is the field related to the study of ethical issues in AI. To address AI ethics, one needs to consider the ethics of AI and how to build ethical AI. Ethics of AI studies the ethical principles, rules, guidelines, policies, and regulations that are related to AI. Ethical AI is an AI that performs and behaves ethically. One must recognize and understand the potential ethical and moral issues that may be caused by AI to formulate the necessary ethical principles, rules, guidelines, policies, and regulations for AI (i.e., Ethics of AI). With the appropriate ethics of AI, one can then build AI that exhibits ethical behavior (i.e., Ethical AI). This paper will discuss AI ethics by looking at the ethics of AI and ethical AI. What are the perceived ethical and moral issues with AI? What are the general and common ethical principles, rules, guidelines, policies, and regulations that can resolve or at least attenuate these ethical and moral issues with AI? What are some of the necessary features and characteristics of an ethical AI? How to adhere to the ethics of AI to build ethical AI?"}, "authors": [{"id": "1746885", "name": "K.

While media and policy discourse often portray China’s AI development in terms of a unified national strategy, and a burgeoning geopolitical contestation for future global dominance, this analysis will suggest a more nuanced internal complexity, involving differing regional networks and international corporate activity. The first section considers two key policy documents published by the central Chinese government, which are shown to implicate educational institutions as influential actors in national and regional strategies for AI development, with a significant role in plans to train domestic expertise. The second section outlines three prominent private education companies: New Oriental Group, Tomorrow Advancing Life (TAL), and Squirrel AI. These companies are selected to represent important aspects of China’s development of educational AI applications, including the influence of a well-established private education sector, and a growing interest in international corporate activity. The paper concludes with the suggestion that while central government policy reserves a significant role for education in the national AI strategy, the private sector is utilising favourable political conditions to rapidly develop educational applications and markets."}, "authors": [{"id": "2253730621", "name": "Jeremy Knox"}], "fields_of_study": ["Business"]}

Applying AI chatbots to lifestyle modification programs is one of the promising areas to develop cost-effective and feasible behavior interventions to promote physical activity and a healthy diet. Objective The purposes of this perspective paper are to present a brief literature review of chatbot use in promoting physical activity and a healthy diet, describe the AI chatbot behavior change model our research team developed based on extensive interdisciplinary research, and discuss ethical principles and considerations. Methods We conducted a preliminary search of studies reporting chatbots for improving physical activity and/or diet in four databases in July 2020. We summarized the characteristics of the chatbot studies and reviewed recent developments in human-AI communication research and innovations in natural language processing. Based on the identified gaps and opportunities, as well as our own clinical and research experience and findings, we propose an AI chatbot behavior change model. Results Our review found a lack of understanding around theoretical guidance and practical recommendations on designing AI chatbots for lifestyle modification programs. The proposed AI chatbot behavior change model consists of the following four components to provide such guidance: (1) designing chatbot characteristics and understanding user background; (2) building relational capacity; (3) building persuasive conversational capacity; and (4) evaluating mechanisms and outcomes. The rationale and evidence supporting the design and evaluation choices for this model are presented in this paper. Conclusions As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated into various digital communications, our proposed theoretical framework is the first step to conceptualize the scope of utilization in health behavior change domains and to synthesize all possible dimensions of chatbot features to inform intervention design and evaluation. There is a need for more interdisciplinary work to continue developing AI techniques to improve a chatbot’s relational and persuasive capacities to change physical activity and diet behaviors with strong ethical principles."}, "authors": [{"id": "50561415", "name": "Jingwen Zhang"}, {"id": "2072731142", "name": "Y.

Therefore, modeling and predicting water quality have become very important in controlling water pollution.

For the WQI prediction, artificial neural network models, namely nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NARNET) and long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning algorithm, have been developed. In addition, three machine learning algorithms, namely, support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), and Naive Bayes, have been used for the WQC forecasting. The used dataset has 7 significant parameters, and the developed models were evaluated based on some statistical parameters. The results revealed that the proposed models can accurately predict WQI and classify the water quality according to superior robustness. Prediction results demonstrated that the NARNET model performed slightly better than the LSTM for the prediction of the WQI values and the SVM algorithm has achieved the highest accuracy (97.01%) for the WQC prediction. Furthermore, the NARNET and LSTM models have achieved similar accuracy for the testing phase with a slight difference in the regression coefficient (RNARNET = 96.17% and RLSTM = 94.21%).

We propose that explainable AI systems deliver accompanying evidence or reasons for outcomes and processes; provide explanations that are understandable to individual users; provide explanations that correctly reﬂect the system’s process for generating the output; and that a system only operates under conditions for which it was designed and when it reaches sufﬁcient conﬁdence in its output. We have termed these four principles as explanation, meaningful, explanation accuracy, and knowledge limits, respectively. Through signiﬁcant stakeholder engagement, these four principles were developed to encompass the multidisciplinary nature of explainable AI, including the ﬁelds of computer science, engineering, and psychology. Because one-size-ﬁts-all explanations do not exist, different users will require different types of explanations. We present ﬁve categories of explanation and summarize theories of explainable AI. We give an overview of the algorithms in the ﬁeld that cover the major classes of explainable algorithms. As a baseline comparison, we assess how well explanations provided by people follow our four principles. This assessment provides insights to the challenges of designing explainable AI systems."}, "authors": [{"id": "95739027", "name": "P. Phillips"}, {"id": "3430785", "name": "Carina A.

The collected data and analytical results provided insights regarding the self-reported perceptions of primary students’ AI readiness and enabled the identification of factors that may influence this parameter. The results indicated that AI literacy was not predictive of AI readiness. The influences of AI literacy were mediated by the students’ confidence and perception of AI relevance. The students’ AI readiness was not influenced by a reduction in their anxiety regarding AI and an enhancement in their AI literacy. Male students reported a higher confidence, relevance, and readiness for AI than female students did. The sentiments reflected by the open-ended responses of the students indicated that the students were generally excited to learn about AI and viewed AI as a powerful and useful technology. The student sentiments confirmed the quantitative findings.

The aim of the present study was to introduce a short measure to assess the Attitude Towards Artificial Intelligence (ATAI scale) in the German, Chinese, and English languages. Participants from Germany (N = 461; 345 females), China (N = 413; 145 females), and the UK (N = 84; 65 females) completed the ATAI scale, for which the factorial structure was tested and compared between the samples. Participants from Germany and China were additionally asked about their willingness to interact with/use self-driving cars, Siri, Alexa, the social robot Pepper, and the humanoid robot Erica, which are representatives of popular artificial intelligence products. The results showed that the five-item ATAI scale comprises two negatively associated factors assessing (1) acceptance and (2) fear of artificial intelligence. The factor structure was found to be similar across the German, Chinese, and UK samples. Additionally, the ATAI scale was validated, as the items on the willingness to use specific artificial intelligence products were positively associated with the ATAI Acceptance scale and negatively with the ATAI Fear scale, in both the German and Chinese samples. In conclusion we introduce a short, reliable, and valid measure on the attitude towards artificial intelligence in German, Chinese, and English language."}, "authors": [{"id": "5408820", "name": "C.

The specific area of the jaw and teeth associated with the periapical lesions were then determined by a human observer. Lesion volumes were calculated using the manual segmentation methods using Fujifilm-Synapse 3D software (Fujifilm Medical Systems, Stamford, Conn, USA). The neural network was then used to determine (1) whether the lesion could be detected; (2) if the lesion was detected, where it was localized (maxilla, mandible, or specific tooth); and (3) lesion volume. Manual segmentation and artificial intelligence (AI) (Diagnocat Inc., Moscow, Russia) methods were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test and Bland-Altman analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe deep convolutional neural network system was successful in detecting teeth and numbering specific teeth. Only one tooth was incorrectly identified. The AI system was able to detect 142 of a total of 153 periapical lesions. The reliability of correctly detecting a periapical lesion was 92.8%. The deep convolutional neural network volumetric measurements of the lesions were similar to those with manual segmentation. There was no significant difference between the two measurements methods (p> 0,05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nVolume measurements performed by humans and by AI systems were comparable to each other.

Assistive AI achieves accuracy comparable to or even surpassing that of human experts. However, often the adoption of assistive AI systems is limited by a lack of trust of humans into an AI’s prediction. This is why the AI research community has been focusing on rendering AI decisions more transparent by providing explanations of an AIs decision. To what extent these explanations really help to foster trust into an AI system remains an open question. In this paper, we report the results of a behavioural experiment in which subjects were able to draw on the support of an ML-based decision support tool for text classification. We experimentally varied the information subjects received and show that transparency can actually have a negative impact on trust. We discuss implications for decision makers employing assistive AI technology."}, "authors": [{"id": "144906813", "name": "Philipp Schmidt"}, {"id": "2170760", "name": "F.

Implicitly, artificial intelligence (the philosophies of machines to think, behave and perform either same or similar to humans) has knocked the doors of business organizations as an imperative activity. Artificial intelligence, as a discipline, initiated by scientist John McCarthy and formally publicized at Dartmouth Conference in 1956, now occupies a central stage for many organizations. Implementation of artificial intelligence provides competitive edge to an organization with a definite augmentation in its social and corporate status. Mere application of a concept will not furnish real output until and unless its performance is reviewed systematically. Technological changes are dynamic and advancing at a rapid rate. Subsequently, it becomes highly crucial to understand that where have the people reached with respect to artificial intelligence research. The present article aims to review significant work by eminent researchers towards artificial intelligence in the form of top contributing universities, authors, keywords, funding sources, journals and citation statistics.Design/methodology/approachAs rightly remarked by past researchers that reviewing is learning from experience, research team has reviewed (by applying systematic literature review through bibliometric analysis) the concept of artificial intelligence in this article.

However, in recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has made enormous advances, particularly in the area of image classification. This has led computer scientists to apply these techniques to develop algorithms that are able to recognize skin lesions, particularly melanoma. Since 2017, there have been numerous studies assessing the accuracy of algorithms, with some reporting that the accuracy matches or surpasses that of a dermatologist. While the principles underlying these methods are relatively straightforward, it can be challenging for the practising dermatologist to make sense of a plethora of unfamiliar terms in this domain. Here we explain the concepts of AI, machine learning, neural networks and deep learning, and explore the principles of how these tasks are accomplished. We critically evaluate the studies that have assessed the efficacy of these methods and discuss limitations and potential ethical issues. The burden of skin cancer is growing within the Western world, with major implications for both population skin health and the provision of dermatology services. AI has the potential to assist in the diagnosis of skin lesions and may have particular value at the interface between primary and secondary care. The emerging technology represents an exciting opportunity for dermatologists, who are the individuals best informed to explore the utility of this powerful novel diagnostic tool, and facilitate its safe and ethical implementation within healthcare systems."}, "authors": [{"id": "2286931107", "name": "D.

The authors present several caveats associated with such practices based on a series of randomized field experiments. Experiment 1 shows that the incremental benefit of the AI coach over human managers is heterogeneous across agents in an inverted-U shape: whereas middle-ranked agents improve their performance by the largest amount, both bottom- and top-ranked agents show limited incremental gains. This pattern is driven by a learning-based mechanism in which bottom-ranked agents encounter the most severe information overload problem with the AI versus human coach, while top-ranked agents hold the strongest aversion to the AI relative to a human coach. To alleviate the challenge faced by bottom-ranked agents, Experiment 2 redesigns the AI coach by restricting the training feedback level and shows a significant improvement in agent performance. Experiment 3 reveals that the AI–human coach assemblage outperforms either the AI or human coach alone. This assemblage can harness the hard data skills of the AI coach and soft interpersonal skills of human managers, solving both problems faced by bottom- and top-ranked agents. These findings offer novel insights into AI coaches for researchers and managers alike."}, "authors": [{"id": "40581742", "name": "Xueming Luo"}, {"id": "67083458", "name": "M.

Thus, the aim of the present research was to analyze, systematically, the scientific literature relating to the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) in industry. In fact, with the introduction of the Industry 4.0, artificial intelligence and machine learning are considered the driving force of smart factory revolution. The purpose of this review was to classify the literature, including publication year, authors, scientific sector, country, institution, and keywords. The analysis was done using the Web of Science and SCOPUS database. Furthermore, UCINET and NVivo 12 software were used to complete them. A literature review on ML and AI empirical studies published in the last century was carried out to highlight the evolution of the topic before and after Industry 4.0 introduction, from 1999 to now.

However, unlike frequently discussed applications of AI in autonomous vehicles, military and cybersecurity concerns, and healthcare, AI’s impacts on education policy and practice have not yet captured the public’s attention. This paper, therefore, evaluates the status of AIEd, with special attention to intelligent tutoring systems and anthropomorphized artificial educational agents. I discuss AIEd’s purported capacities, including the abilities to simulate teachers, provide robust student differentiation, and even foster socio-emotional engagement. Next, to situate developmental pathways for AIEd going forward, I contrast sociotechnical possibilities and risks through two idealized futures. Finally, I consider a recent proposal to use peer review as a gatekeeping strategy to prevent harmful research.

The application of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies has provided new methodologies to utilize large amounts of data for educational purposes. A significant criticism of the use of artificial intelligence in education has been a lack of transparency in the algorithms’ decision-making processes. This study aims to 1) introduce a new framework using explainable artificial intelligence for simulation-based training in surgery, and 2) validate the framework by creating the Virtual Operative Assistant, an automated educational feedback platform. Twenty-eight skilled participants (14 staff neurosurgeons, 4 fellows, 10 PGY 4–6 residents) and 22 novice participants (10 PGY 1–3 residents, 12 medical students) took part in this study. Participants performed a virtual reality subpial brain tumor resection task on the NeuroVR simulator using a simulated ultrasonic aspirator and bipolar. Metrics of performance were developed, and leave-one-out cross validation was employed to train and validate a support vector machine in Matlab. The classifier was combined with a unique educational system to build the Virtual Operative Assistant which provides users with automated feedback on their metric performance with regards to expert proficiency performance benchmarks. The Virtual Operative Assistant successfully classified skilled and novice participants using 4 metrics with an accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of 92, 82 and 100%, respectively. A 2-step feedback system was developed to provide participants with an immediate visual representation of their standing related to expert proficiency performance benchmarks. The educational system outlined establishes a basis for the potential role of integrating artificial intelligence and virtual reality simulation into surgical educational teaching. The potential of linking expertise classification, objective feedback based on proficiency benchmarks, and instructor input creates a novel educational tool by integrating these three components into a formative educational paradigm."}, "authors": [{"id": "51970365", "name": "Nykan Mirchi"}, {"id": "145165917", "name": "Vincent Bissonnette"}, {"id": "147991478", "name": "R.

It is possible to pursue this goal without assuming that machine intelligence is identical to human intelligence. This is known as weak AI. However, many AI researcher have pursued the aim of developing artificial intelligence that is in principle identical to human intelligence, called strong AI. Weak AI is less ambitious than strong AI, and therefore less controversial. However, there are important controversies related to weak AI as well. This paper focuses on the distinction between artificial general intelligence (AGI) and artificial narrow intelligence (ANI). Although AGI may be classified as weak AI, it is close to strong AI because one chief characteristics of human intelligence is its generality. Although AGI is less ambitious than strong AI, there were critics almost from the very beginning. One of the leading critics was the philosopher Hubert Dreyfus, who argued that computers, who have no body, no childhood and no cultural practice, could not acquire intelligence at all. One of Dreyfus’ main arguments was that human knowledge is partly tacit, and therefore cannot be articulated and incorporated in a computer program. However, today one might argue that new approaches to artificial intelligence research have made his arguments obsolete. Deep learning and Big Data are among the latest approaches, and advocates argue that they will be able to realize AGI. A closer look reveals that although development of artificial intelligence for specific purposes (ANI) has been impressive, we have not come much closer to developing artificial general intelligence (AGI). The article further argues that this is in principle impossible, and it revives Hubert Dreyfus’ argument that computers are not in the world."}, "authors": [{"id": "2398461", "name": "Ragnar Fjelland"}], "fields_of_study": ["Sociology"]}

We also hand searched premier computer science journals and conferences as well as registered clinical trials. Studies were included if they reported AI applications that had been implemented in real-world clinical settings.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe identified 51 relevant studies that reported the implementation and evaluation of AI applications in clinical practice, of which 13 adopted a randomized controlled trial design and eight adopted an experimental design. The AI applications targeted various clinical tasks, such as screening or triage (n=16), disease diagnosis (n=16), risk analysis (n=14), and treatment (n=7). The most commonly addressed diseases and conditions were sepsis (n=6), breast cancer (n=5), diabetic retinopathy (n=4), and polyp and adenoma (n=4). Regarding the evaluation outcomes, we found that 26 studies examined the performance of AI applications in clinical settings, 33 studies examined the effect of AI applications on clinician outcomes, 14 studies examined the effect on patient outcomes, and one study examined the economic impact associated with AI implementation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis review indicates that research on the clinical implementation of AI applications is still at an early stage despite the great potential.

This is because con ‐ ventional MPPT techniques are incapable of tracking the global maximum power point (GMPP) under partial shading condition (PSC). The output curve of the power versus voltage for a solar panel has only one GMPP and multiple local maximum power points (MPPs). The integration of AI in MPPT is crucial to guarantee the tracking of GMPP while increasing the overall ef ‐ ficiency and performance of MPPT. The selection of AI-based MPPT techniques is complicated because each technique has its own merits and demerits. In general, all of the AI-based MPPT techniques exhibit fast convergence speed, less steady-state oscil ‐ lation and high efficiency, compared with the conventional MPPT techniques. However, the AI-based MPPT techniques are computationally intensive and costly to realize.

The purpose of this study is to assess the awareness of AI technologies among health professionals and to investigate their perceptions toward AI applications in medicine. Design: A web-based Google Forms survey was distributed via the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust e-newsletter. Setting: Only staff working at the NHS Foundation Trust received an invitation to complete the online questionnaire. Participants: 98 healthcare professionals out of 7,538 (response rate 1.3%; CI 95%; margin of error 9.64%) completed the survey, including medical doctors, nurses, therapists, managers, and others. Primary outcome: To investigate the prior knowledge of health professionals on the subject of AI as well as their attitudes and worries about its current and future applications. Results: 64% of respondents reported never coming across applications of AI in their work and 87% did not know the difference between machine learning and deep learning, although 50% knew at least one of the two terms. Furthermore, only 5% stated using speech recognition or transcription applications on a daily basis, while 63% never utilize them. 80% of participants believed there may be serious privacy issues associated with the use of AI and 40% considered AI to be potentially even more dangerous than nuclear weapons. However, 79% also believed AI could be useful or extremely useful in their field of work and only 10% were worried AI will replace them at their job. Conclusions: Despite agreeing on the usefulness of AI in the medical field, most health professionals lack a full understanding of the principles of AI and are worried about potential consequences of its widespread use in clinical practice. The cooperation of healthcare workers is crucial for the integration of AI into clinical practice and without it the NHS may miss out on an exceptionally rewarding opportunity.

Understanding these discussions can help institutions, governments, and individuals navigate the pandemic. Objective The aim of this study is to analyze discussions on Twitter related to COVID-19 and to investigate the sentiments toward COVID-19. Methods This study applied machine learning methods in the field of artificial intelligence to analyze data collected from Twitter. Using tweets originating exclusively in the United States and written in English during the 1-month period from March 20 to April 19, 2020, the study examined COVID-19–related discussions. Social network and sentiment analyses were also conducted to determine the social network of dominant topics and whether the tweets expressed positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. Geographic analysis of the tweets was also conducted. Results There were a total of 14,180,603 likes, 863,411 replies, 3,087,812 retweets, and 641,381 mentions in tweets during the study timeframe. Out of 902,138 tweets analyzed, sentiment analysis classified 434,254 (48.2%) tweets as having a positive sentiment, 187,042 (20.7%) as neutral, and 280,842 (31.1%) as negative. The study identified 5 dominant themes among COVID-19–related tweets: health care environment, emotional support, business economy, social change, and psychological stress. Alaska, Wyoming, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Florida were the states expressing the most negative sentiment while Vermont, North Dakota, Utah, Colorado, Tennessee, and North Carolina conveyed the most positive sentiment. Conclusions This study identified 5 prevalent themes of COVID-19 discussion with sentiments ranging from positive to negative. These themes and sentiments can clarify the public’s response to COVID-19 and help officials navigate the pandemic."}, "authors": [{"id": "30065977", "name": "Man Hung"}, {"id": "146624466", "name": "E.

Firstly, we discuss the conceptual distinction between transparency in AI and algorithmic transparency, and argue for the wider concept ‘in AI’, as a partly contested albeit useful notion in relation to transparency. Secondly, we show that transparency as a general concept is multifaceted, and of widespread theoretical use in multiple disciplines over time, particularly since the 1990s. Still, it has had a resurgence in contemporary notions of AI governance, such as in the multitude of recently published ethics guidelines on AI. Thirdly, we discuss and show the relevance of the fact that transparency expresses a conceptual metaphor of more general significance, linked to knowing, bringing positive connotations that may have normative effects to regulatory debates. Finally, we draw a possible categorisation of aspects related to transparency in AI, or what we interchangeably call AI transparency, and argue for the need of developing a multidisciplinary understanding, in order to contribute to the governance of AI as applied on markets and in society.

There is a significant amount of research into the ethical consequences of artificial intelligence (AI). This is reflected by many outputs across academia, policy and the media. Many of these outputs aim to provide guidance to particular stakeholder groups. It has recently been shown that there is a large degree of convergence in terms of the principles upon which these guidance documents are based. Despite this convergence, it is not always clear how these principles are to be translated into practice.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nIn this paper, the authors move beyond the high-level ethical principles that are common across the AI ethics guidance literature and provide a description of the normative content that is covered by these principles. The outcome is a comprehensive compilation of normative requirements arising from existing guidance documents. This is not only required for a deeper theoretical understanding of AI ethics discussions but also for the creation of practical and implementable guidance for developers and users of AI.\n\n\nFindings\nIn this paper, the authors therefore provide a detailed explanation of the normative implications of existing AI ethics guidelines but directed towards developers and organisational users of AI. The authors believe that the paper provides the most comprehensive account of ethical requirements in AI currently available, which is of interest not only to the research and policy communities engaged in the topic but also to the user communities that require guidance when developing or deploying AI systems.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe authors believe that they have managed to compile the most comprehensive document collecting existing guidance which can guide practical action but will hopefully also support the consolidation of the guidelines landscape. The authors’ findings should also be of academic interest and inspire philosophical research on the consistency and justification of the various normative statements that can be found in the literature.\n"}, "authors": [{"id": "144422064", "name": "M.

To prevent the negative outcomes and to achieve accountable systems, many have argued that we need to open up the “black box” of AI decision-making and make it more transparent. Whereas this debate has primarily focused on how transparency can secure high-quality, fair, and reliable decisions, far less attention has been devoted to the role of transparency when it comes to how the general public come to perceive AI decision-making as legitimate and worthy of acceptance. Since relying on coercion is not only normatively problematic but also costly and highly inefficient, perceived legitimacy is fundamental to the democratic system. This paper discusses how transparency in and about AI decision-making can affect the public’s perception of the legitimacy of decisions and decision-makers and produce a framework for analyzing these questions. We argue that a limited form of transparency that focuses on providing justifications for decisions has the potential to provide sufficient ground for perceived legitimacy without producing the harms full transparency would bring."}, "authors": [{"id": "66526158", "name": "Karl de Fine Licht"}, {"id": "31966701", "name": "Jenny de Fine Licht"}], "fields_of_study": ["Political Science", "Computer Science"]}

These approaches identify patterns in large scale datasets, and make classifications and predictions, which have been celebrated as more accurate than those of humans. But for a number of reasons, including nonlinear path from inputs to outputs, there is a dearth of theory that can explain why deep learning techniques work so well at pattern detection and prediction. Claims about “superhuman” accuracy and insight, paired with the inability to fully explain how these results are produced, form a discourse about AI that we call enchanted determinism . To analyze enchanted determinism, we situate it within a broader epistemological diagnosis of modernity: Max Weber’s theory of disenchantment. Deep learning occupies an ambiguous position in this framework. On one hand, it represents a complex form of technological calculation and prediction, phenomena Weber associated with disenchantment. On the other hand, both deep learning experts and observers deploy enchanted, magical discourses to describe these systems’ uninterpretable mechanisms and counter-intuitive behavior. The combination of predictive accuracy and mysterious or unexplainable properties results in myth-making about deep learning’s transcendent, superhuman capacities, especially when it is applied in social settings. We analyze how discourses of magical deep learning produce techno-optimism, drawing on case studies from game-playing, adversarial examples, and attempts to infer sexual orientation from facial images. Enchantment shields the creators of these systems from accountability while its deterministic, calculative power intensifies social processes of classification and control."}, "authors": [{"id": "1510783968", "name": "Alexander Campolo"}, {"id": "48024382", "name": "K.

Since previous research has shown that media coverage can drive public discourse about novel technologies, studying how the ethical issues of AI are portrayed in the media may lead to greater insight into the potential ramifications of this public discourse, particularly with regard to development and regulation of AI. This paper expands upon previous research by systematically analyzing and categorizing the media portrayal of the ethical issues of AI to better understand how media coverage of these issues may shape public debate about AI. Our results suggest that the media has a fairly realistic and practical focus in its coverage of the ethics of AI, but that the coverage is still shallow. A multifaceted approach to handling the social, ethical and policy issues of AI technology is needed, including increasing the accessibility of correct information to the public in the form of fact sheets and ethical value statements on trusted webpages (e.g., government agencies), collaboration and inclusion of ethics and AI experts in both research and public debate, and consistent government policies or regulatory frameworks for AI technology."}, "authors": [{"id": "1597817432", "name": "Leila Ouchchy"}, {"id": "1597772924", "name": "Allen Coin"}, {"id": "6833975", "name": "Veljko Dubljević"}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Political Science"]}

Recently, innovation in artificial intelligence (AI) in the shape of self-driving cars, robots and city brains, has been pushing the so-called smart city to morph into an autonomous urban creature which is largely unknown. In this emerging strand of smart urbanism, artificially intelligent entities are taking the management of urban services as well as urban governance out of the hands of humans, operating the city in an autonomous manner. This paper explores, in theory and practice, how the development of AI intersects with the development of the city. The contribution of the paper is threefold. First, the paper advances a theoretical framework to understand AI specifically in urban contexts. It develops the concept of urban artificial intelligence, capturing the main manifestations of AI in cities. Second, the paper examines the case of Masdar City, an Emirati urban experiment, to show how the genesis of urban artificial intelligences is part of a long-standing process of technological development and a politico-economic agenda which together are enabling the transition from automation to autonomy. Third, it proposes a research agenda to investigate what the paper terms the autonomous city."}, "authors": [{"id": "94306821", "name": "Federico Cugurullo"}], "fields_of_study": ["Sociology"]}

Six areas where AI can contribute to the fight against COVID-19 are discussed, namely i) early warnings and alerts, ii) tracking and prediction, iii) data dashboards, iv) diagnosis and prognosis, v) treatments and cures, and vi) social control. It is concluded that AI has not yet been impactful against COVID-19. Its use is hampered by a lack of data, and by too much data. Overcoming these constraints will require a careful balance between data privacy and public health, and rigorous human-AI interaction.

Rapid developments in AI have the potential to reduce the cost of core governance functions, improve the quality of decisions, and unleash the power of administrative data, thereby making government performance more efficient and effective. Agencies that use AI to realize these gains will also confront important questions about the proper design of algorithms and user interfaces, the respective scope of human and machine decision-making, the boundaries between public actions and private contracting, their own capacity to learn over time using AI, and whether the use of AI is even permitted. \n \nThese are important issues for public debate and academic inquiry. Yet little is known about how agencies are currently using AI systems beyond a few headline-grabbing examples or surface-level descriptions. Moreover, even amidst growing public and scholarly discussion about how society might regulate government use of AI, little attention has been devoted to how agencies acquire such tools in the first place or oversee their use. In an effort to fill these gaps, the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) commissioned this report from researchers at Stanford University and New York University.

There has been an increase in the research and development of AI applications for nursing care, but there is a persistent lack of an extensive overview covering the evidence base for promising application scenarios. Objective This study synthesizes literature on application scenarios for AI in nursing care settings as well as highlights adjacent aspects in the ethical, legal, and social discourse surrounding the application of AI in nursing care. Methods Following a rapid review design, PubMed, CINAHL, Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore, Digital Bibliography & Library Project, and Association for Information Systems Library, as well as the libraries of leading AI conferences, were searched in June 2020. Publications of original quantitative and qualitative research, systematic reviews, discussion papers, and essays on the ethical, legal, and social implications published in English were included. Eligible studies were analyzed on the basis of predetermined selection criteria. Results The titles and abstracts of 7016 publications and 704 full texts were screened, and 292 publications were included. Hospitals were the most prominent study setting, followed by independent living at home; fewer application scenarios were identified for nursing homes or home care. Most studies used machine learning algorithms, whereas expert or hybrid systems were entailed in less than every 10th publication. The application context of focusing on image and signal processing with tracking, monitoring, or the classification of activity and health followed by care coordination and communication, as well as fall detection, was the main purpose of AI applications. Few studies have reported the effects of AI applications on clinical or organizational outcomes, lacking particularly in data gathered outside laboratory conditions. In addition to technological requirements, the reporting and inclusion of certain requirements capture more overarching topics, such as data privacy, safety, and technology acceptance. Ethical, legal, and social implications reflect the discourse on technology use in health care but have mostly not been discussed in meaningful and potentially encompassing detail. Conclusions The results highlight the potential for the application of AI systems in different nursing care settings. Considering the lack of findings on the effectiveness and application of AI systems in real-world scenarios, future research should reflect on a more nursing care–specific perspective toward objectives, outcomes, and benefits. We identify that, crucially, an advancement in technological-societal discourse that surrounds the ethical and legal implications of AI applications in nursing care is a necessary next step. Further, we outline the need for greater participation among all of the stakeholders involved."}, "authors": [{"id": "117655205", "name": "Kathrin Seibert"}, {"id": "12507003", "name": "Dominik Domhoff"}, {"id": "2122781516", "name": "Dominik Bruch"}, {"id": "1416069619", "name": "Matthias Schulte-Althoff"}, {"id": "2297514", "name": "Daniel Fürstenau"}, {"id": "2170760", "name": "F.

Therefore, diverse groups of responsible employees deal with the large amount and variety of information, which must be acquired and interpreted correctly to deduce adequate alternatives. The technological potential of artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to offer further support, although research in this regard is still developing. However, as the technology is designed to have capabilities beyond those of traditional machines, the effects on the division of tasks and the definition of roles established in the current human–machine relationship are discussed with increasing awareness. Based on a systematic literature review, combined with content analysis, this article provides an overview of the possibilities that current research identifies for integrating AI into organizational decision making under uncertainty. The findings are summarized in a conceptual model that first explains how humans can use AI for decision making under uncertainty and then identifies the challenges, pre-conditions, and consequences that must be considered. While research on organizational structures, the choice of AI application, and the possibilities of knowledge management is extensive, a clear recommendation for ethical frameworks, despite being defined as a crucial foundation, is missing. In addition, AI, other than traditional machines, can amplify problems inherent in the decision-making process rather than help to reduce them. As a result, the human responsibility increases, while the capabilities needed to use the technology differ from other machines, thus making education necessary. These findings make the study valuable for both researchers and practitioners."}, "authors": [{"id": "87617672", "name": "Anne D.

They are increasingly prevalent in health care applications such as those providing education and support to patients with chronic diseases, one of the leading causes of death in the 21st century. AI-based chatbots enable more effective and frequent interactions with such patients. Objective The goal of this systematic literature review is to review the characteristics, health care conditions, and AI architectures of AI-based conversational agents designed specifically for chronic diseases. Methods We conducted a systematic literature review using PubMed MEDLINE, EMBASE, PyscInfo, CINAHL, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. We applied a predefined search strategy using the terms “conversational agent,” “healthcare,” “artificial intelligence,” and their synonyms. We updated the search results using Google alerts, and screened reference lists for other relevant articles. We included primary research studies that involved the prevention, treatment, or rehabilitation of chronic diseases, involved a conversational agent, and included any kind of AI architecture. Two independent reviewers conducted screening and data extraction, and Cohen kappa was used to measure interrater agreement.A narrative approach was applied for data synthesis. Results The literature search found 2052 articles, out of which 10 papers met the inclusion criteria. The small number of identified studies together with the prevalence of quasi-experimental studies (n=7) and prevailing prototype nature of the chatbots (n=7) revealed the immaturity of the field. The reported chatbots addressed a broad variety of chronic diseases (n=6), showcasing a tendency to develop specialized conversational agents for individual chronic conditions. However, there lacks comparison of these chatbots within and between chronic diseases. In addition, the reported evaluation measures were not standardized, and the addressed health goals showed a large range. Together, these study characteristics complicated comparability and open room for future research. While natural language processing represented the most used AI technique (n=7) and the majority of conversational agents allowed for multimodal interaction (n=6), the identified studies demonstrated broad heterogeneity, lack of depth of reported AI techniques and systems, and inconsistent usage of taxonomy of the underlying AI software, further aggravating comparability and generalizability of study results. Conclusions The literature on AI-based conversational agents for chronic conditions is scarce and mostly consists of quasi-experimental studies with chatbots in prototype stage that use natural language processing and allow for multimodal user interaction. Future research could profit from evidence-based evaluation of the AI-based conversational agents and comparison thereof within and between different chronic health conditions. Besides increased comparability, the quality of chatbots developed for specific chronic conditions and their subsequent impact on the target patients could be enhanced by more structured development and standardized evaluation processes."}, "authors": [{"id": "113824585", "name": "T.

Patients and methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective trials to determine the value of AI-based polyp detection systems for detection of polyps and colorectal cancer. We performed systematic searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL. Independent reviewers screened studies and assessed eligibility, certainty of evidence, and risk of bias. We compared colonoscopy with and without AI by calculating relative and absolute risks and mean differences for detection of polyps, adenomas, and colorectal cancer. Results Five randomized trials were eligible for analysis. Colonoscopy with AI increased adenoma detection rates (ADRs) and polyp detection rates (PDRs) compared to colonoscopy without AI (values given with 95 %CI). ADR with AI was 29.6 % (22.2 % – 37.0 %) versus 19.3 % (12.7 % – 25.9 %) without AI; relative risk (RR] 1.52 (1.31 – 1.77), with high certainty. PDR was 45.4 % (41.1 % – 49.8 %) with AI versus 30.6 % (26.5 % – 34.6 %) without AI; RR 1.48 (1.37 – 1.60), with high certainty. There was no difference in detection of advanced adenomas (mean advanced adenomas per colonoscopy 0.03 for each group, high certainty). Mean adenomas detected per colonoscopy was higher for small adenomas (≤ 5 mm) for AI versus non-AI (mean difference 0.15 [0.12 – 0.18]), but not for larger adenomas (> 5 – ≤ 10 mm, mean difference 0.03 [0.01 – 0.05]; > 10 mm, mean difference 0.01 [0.00 – 0.02]; high certainty).

Furthermore, there has been little discussion on how AI will influence the experience of person-centered compassionate care for patients, families, and caregivers. Objective This review aims to summarize the extant literature on the emerging trends in health technologies powered by AI and their implications on the following domains of nursing: administration, clinical practice, policy, and research. This review summarizes the findings from 3 research questions, examining how these emerging trends might influence the roles and functions of nurses and compassionate nursing care over the next 10 years and beyond. Methods Using an established scoping review methodology, MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central, Education Resources Information Center, Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest databases were searched. In addition to the electronic database searches, a targeted website search was performed to access relevant gray literature. Abstracts and full-text studies were independently screened by 2 reviewers using prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included articles focused on nursing and digital health technologies that incorporate AI. Data were charted using structured forms and narratively summarized. Results A total of 131 articles were retrieved from the scoping review for the 3 research questions that were the focus of this manuscript (118 from database sources and 13 from targeted websites). Emerging AI technologies discussed in the review included predictive analytics, smart homes, virtual health care assistants, and robots. The results indicated that AI has already begun to influence nursing roles, workflows, and the nurse-patient relationship. In general, robots are not viewed as replacements for nurses. There is a consensus that health technologies powered by AI may have the potential to enhance nursing practice. Consequently, nurses must proactively define how person-centered compassionate care will be preserved in the age of AI. Conclusions Nurses have a shared responsibility to influence decisions related to the integration of AI into the health system and to ensure that this change is introduced in a way that is ethical and aligns with core nursing values such as compassionate care. Furthermore, nurses must advocate for patient and nursing involvement in all aspects of the design, implementation, and evaluation of these technologies.

Support vector machines and random forests were the most popular ML methods used. ML models using data on multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease were most common. A small proportion of studies (7.7% or 13/169) combined different data types in the modelling process. Cross-validation, combined with a separate testing set for more robust model evaluation occurred in 8.3% of papers (14/169). The field may benefit from adopting a best practice of validation, cross-validation and independent testing of ML models.

We focus on two aspects of clinical artificial intelligence used for decision-making: moral accountability for harm to patients; and safety assurance to protect patients against such harm. Artificial intelligence-based tools are challenging the standard clinical practices of assigning blame and assuring safety. Human clinicians and safety engineers have weaker control over the decisions reached by artificial intelligence systems and less knowledge and understanding of precisely how the artificial intelligence systems reach their decisions. We illustrate this analysis by applying it to an example of an artificial intelligence-based system developed for use in the treatment of sepsis. The paper ends with practical suggestions for ways forward to mitigate these concerns. We argue for a need to include artificial intelligence developers and systems safety engineers in our assessments of moral accountability for patient harm. Meanwhile, none of the actors in the model robustly fulfil the traditional conditions of moral accountability for the decisions of an artificial intelligence system. We should therefore update our conceptions of moral accountability in this context. We also need to move from a static to a dynamic model of assurance, accepting that considerations of safety are not fully resolvable during the design of the artificial intelligence system before the system has been deployed."}, "authors": [{"id": "2257272175", "name": "Ibrahim Habli"}, {"id": "2241344216", "name": "Tom Lawton"}, {"id": "31708825", "name": "Zoe Porter"}], "fields_of_study": ["Medicine", "Psychology"]}

Today, various AI applications are being used in areas ranging from marketing to banking and finance, from agriculture to healthcare and security, from space exploration to robotics and transport, and from chatbots to artificial creativity and manufacturing. More recently, AI applications have also started to become an integral part of many urban services. Urban artificial intelligences manage the transport systems of cities, run restaurants and shops where every day urbanity is expressed, repair urban infrastructure, and govern multiple urban domains such as traffic, air quality monitoring, garbage collection, and energy. In the age of uncertainty and complexity that is upon us, the increasing adoption of AI is expected to continue, and so its impact on the sustainability of our cities. This viewpoint explores and questions the sustainability of AI from the lens of smart and sustainable cities, and generates insights into emerging urban artificial intelligences and the potential symbiosis between AI and a smart and sustainable urbanism. In terms of methodology, this viewpoint deploys a thorough review of the current status of AI and smart and sustainable cities literature, research, developments, trends, and applications. In so doing, it contributes to existing academic debates in the fields of smart and sustainable cities and AI. In addition, by shedding light on the uptake of AI in cities, the viewpoint seeks to help urban policymakers, planners, and citizens make informed decisions about a sustainable adoption of AI."}, "authors": [{"id": "3266895", "name": "Tan Yigitcanlar"}, {"id": "94306821", "name": "Federico Cugurullo"}], "fields_of_study": ["Business"]}

This commentary reverses the current emphasis on algorithms and AI methods, by putting humans at the center of systems design thinking, in effect, a second Copernican Revolution. It offers three ideas: (1) a two-dimensional HCAI framework, which shows how it is possible to have both high levels of human control AND high levels of automation, (2) a shift from emulating humans to empowering people with a plea to shift language, imagery, and metaphors away from portrayals of intelligent autonomous teammates towards descriptions of powerful tool-like appliances and tele-operated devices, and (3) a three-level governance structure that describes how software engineering teams can develop more reliable systems, how managers can emphasize a safety culture across an organization, and how industry-wide certification can promote trustworthy HCAI systems. These ideas will be challenged by some, refined by others, extended to accommodate new technologies, and validated with quantitative and qualitative research.

Purpose To evaluate the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) system for detection of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest radiographs. Materials and Methods An AI system (CAD4COVID-XRay) was trained on 24 678 chest radiographs, including 1540 used only for validation while training. The test set consisted of a set of continuously acquired chest radiographs (n = 454) obtained in patients suspected of having COVID-19 pneumonia between March 4 and April 6, 2020, at one center (223 patients with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] results, 231 with negative RT-PCR results). Radiographs were independently analyzed by six readers and by the AI system. Diagnostic performance was analyzed with the receiver operating characteristic curve. Results For the test set, the mean age of patients was 67 years ± 14.4 (standard deviation) (56% male). With RT-PCR test results as the reference standard, the AI system correctly classified chest radiographs as COVID-19 pneumonia with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81. The system significantly outperformed each reader (P < .001 using the McNemar test) at their highest possible sensitivities. At their lowest sensitivities, only one reader significantly outperformed the AI system (P = .04). Conclusion The performance of an artificial intelligence system in the detection of coronavirus disease 2019 on chest radiographs was comparable with that of six independent readers. © RSNA, 2020"}, "authors": [{"id": "35730362", "name": "K.

With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), education faces two challenges: reaping the benefits of AI to improve education processes, both in the classroom and at the system level; and preparing students for new skillsets for increasingly automated economies and societies. AI applications are often still nascent, but there are many examples of promising uses that foreshadow how AI might transform education. With regard to the classroom, this paper highlights how AI can accelerate personalised learning, the support of students with special needs. At the system level, promising uses include predictive analysis to reduce dropout, and assessing new skillsets. A new demand for complex skills that are less easy to automate (e.g. higher cognitive skills like creativity and critical thinking) is also the consequence of AI and digitalisation. Reaching the full potential of AI requires that stakeholders trust not only the technology, but also its use by humans. This raises new policy challenges around “trustworthy AI”, encompassing the privacy and security of data, but also possible wrongful uses of data leading to biases against individuals or groups."}, "authors": [{"id": "1403805849", "name": "Stéphan Vincent‐Lancrin"}, {"id": "1659280761", "name": "R.

Many rice blast management approaches require know-how of experienced farmers or agronomists. Monitoring the farm for disease detection is labor intensive and time consuming. By using the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), we are able to detect plant diseases more efficiently. Existing AI and IoT studies detect plant diseases by images or nonimage hyperspectral data, which require manual operations to obtain the photographs or data for analysis. Also, image detection typically is too late as rice blast may already spread to other plants. Based on an IoT platform for soil cultivation, we develop the RiceTalk project that utilizes nonimage IoT devices to detect rice blast. Unlike the image-based plant disease detection approaches, our agriculture sensors generate nonimage data that can be automatically trained and analyzed by the AI mechanism in real time. The beauty of RiceTalk is that the AI model is treated as an IoT device and is managed like other IoT devices. In this way, our approach significantly reduces the platform management cost to provide real-time training and predictions.

However, a growing concern is that due to unequal access to computing power, only certain firms and elite universities have advantages in modern AI research. Using a novel dataset of 171394 papers from 57 prestigious computer science conferences, we document that firms, in particular, large technology firms and elite universities have increased participation in major AI conferences since deep learning's unanticipated rise in 2012. The effect is concentrated among elite universities, which are ranked 1-50 in the QS World University Rankings. Further, we find two strategies through which firms increased their presence in AI research: first, they have increased firm-only publications; and second, firms are collaborating primarily with elite universities. Consequently, this increased presence of firms and elite universities in AI research has crowded out mid-tier (QS ranked 201-300) and lower-tier (QS ranked 301-500) universities. To provide causal evidence that deep learning's unanticipated rise resulted in this divergence, we leverage the generalized synthetic control method, a data-driven counterfactual estimator. Using machine learning based text analysis methods, we provide additional evidence that the divergence between these two groups - large firms and non-elite universities - is driven by access to computing power or compute, which we term as the \"compute divide\". This compute divide between large firms and non-elite universities increases concerns around bias and fairness within AI technology, and presents an obstacle towards \"democratizing\" AI.

In recent years, the quest for greater efficiency in health care, including economic efficiency, has often resulted in the side-lining of these values, making it difficult for health-care professionals to incorporate them in practice. Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used in health care. This technology promises greater efficiency and more free time for health-care professionals to focus on the human side of care, including fostering trust relationships and engaging with patients with empathy and compassion. This article considers the vision of efficient, empathetic and trustworthy health care put forward by the proponents of artificial intelligence. The paper suggests that artificial intelligence has the potential to fundamentally alter the way in which empathy, compassion and trust are currently regarded and practised in health care. Moving forward, it is important to re-evaluate whether and how these values could be incorporated and practised within a health-care system where artificial intelligence is increasingly used. Most importantly, society needs to re-examine what kind of health care it ought to promote."}, "authors": [{"id": "6004748", "name": "A. Kerasidou"}], "fields_of_study": ["Medicine", "Psychology"]}

Recently, with the rapid development in urbanization, massive video surveillance data are produced at an unprecedented speed. A traditional solution to deal with the big data would require a large amount of computing and storage resources. With the advances in Internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence, and communication technologies, edge computing offers a new solution to the problem by processing all or part of the data locally at the edge of a surveillance system. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using edge computing for smart parking surveillance tasks, specifically, parking occupancy detection using the real-time video feed. The system processing pipeline is carefully designed with the consideration of flexibility, online surveillance, data transmission, detection accuracy, and system reliability. It enables artificial intelligence at the edge by implementing an enhanced single shot multibox detector (SSD). A few more algorithms are developed either locally at the edge of the system or on the centralized data server targeting optimal system efficiency and accuracy. Thorough field tests were conducted in the Angle Lake parking garage for three months. The experimental results are promising that the final detection method achieves over 95% accuracy in real-world scenarios with high efficiency and reliability. The proposed smart parking surveillance system is a critical component of smart cities and can be a solid foundation for future applications in intelligent transportation systems."}, "authors": [{"id": "3493222", "name": "Ruimin Ke"}, {"id": "66618191", "name": "Yifan Zhuang"}, {"id": "30665376", "name": "Ziyuan Pu"}, {"id": "49416230", "name": "Yinhai Wang"}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"]}

In the present paper, I discuss the value to agriculture from AI over the next decade. The more immediate applications will be to improve precision information about what is happening on the farm by improving what is being detected and measured. A consequence of this are more accurate alerts to farmers. Another is an increased ability to understand why phenomena occur in farm systems, so as to improve their management. From improved data and understanding come improved predictions, enabling more optimal decisions about how to manage farm systems and stimulating the development of decision support and recommender systems. In many cases, robotics and automated systems will remove much of the need for human decision-making and improve farm efficiencies and farm health. Artificial intelligence will also be needed to enable organisations to harness the value of information distributed throughout supply chains, including farm data. Digital twins will also emerge as an important paradigm to improve how information about farm entities is organised to support decision-making. There are also likely to be negative impacts from AI, such as disruption to the roles and skills needed from farm workers, indicating the need to consider the social and ethical impacts of AI each time a new capability is introduced. I conclude that understanding these challenges more deeply tends to highlight new opportunities for positive change."}, "authors": [{"id": "2143607565", "name": "M.

Translation of these findings into the clinic is the logical next step. This translation can only be successful if patients' concerns and questions are addressed suitably. We therefore conducted a survey to evaluate the patients' view of artificial intelligence in melanoma diagnostics in Germany, with a particular focus on patients with a history of melanoma. Participants and Methods: A web-based questionnaire was designed using LimeSurvey, sent by e-mail to university hospitals and melanoma support groups and advertised on social media. The anonymous questionnaire evaluated patients' expectations and concerns toward artificial intelligence in general as well as their attitudes toward different application scenarios. Descriptive analysis was performed with expression of categorical variables as percentages and 95% confidence intervals. Statistical tests were performed to investigate associations between sociodemographic data and selected items of the questionnaire. Results: 298 individuals (154 with a melanoma diagnosis, 143 without) responded to the questionnaire. About 94% [95% CI = 0.91–0.97] of respondents supported the use of artificial intelligence in medical approaches. 88% [95% CI = 0.85–0.92] would even make their own health data anonymously available for the further development of AI-based applications in medicine. Only 41% [95% CI = 0.35–0.46] of respondents were amenable to the use of artificial intelligence as stand-alone system, 94% [95% CI = 0.92–0.97] to its use as assistance system for physicians. In sub-group analyses, only minor differences were detectable. Respondents with a previous history of melanoma were more amenable to the use of AI applications for early detection even at home. They would prefer an application scenario where physician and AI classify the lesions independently. With respect to AI-based applications in medicine, patients were concerned about insufficient data protection, impersonality and susceptibility to errors, but expected faster, more precise and unbiased diagnostics, less diagnostic errors and support for physicians. Conclusions: The vast majority of participants exhibited a positive attitude toward the use of artificial intelligence in melanoma diagnostics, especially as an assistance system."}, "authors": [{"id": "1732815627", "name": "T.

Relevant to our community, it is a prominent source of innovation in healthcare, already helping to develop new drugs, support clinical decisions and provide quality assurance in radiology. The list of medical image‐analysis AI applications with USA Food and Drug Administration or European Union (soon to fall under European Union Medical Device Regulation) approval is growing rapidly and covers diverse clinical needs, such as detection of arrhythmia using a smartwatch or automatic triage of critical imaging studies to the top of the radiologist's worklist. Deep learning, a leading tool of AI, performs particularly well in image pattern recognition and, therefore, can be of great benefit to doctors who rely heavily on images, such as sonologists, radiographers and pathologists. Although obstetric and gynecological ultrasound are two of the most commonly performed imaging studies, AI has had little impact on this field so far. Nevertheless, there is huge potential for AI to assist in repetitive ultrasound tasks, such as automatically identifying good‐quality acquisitions and providing instant quality assurance. For this potential to thrive, interdisciplinary communication between AI developers and ultrasound professionals is necessary. In this article, we explore the fundamentals of medical imaging AI, from theory to applicability, and introduce some key terms to medical professionals in the field of ultrasound. We believe that wider knowledge of AI will help accelerate its integration into healthcare. © 2020 The Authors.

Based on a content analysis of articles on AI published in two magazines, the Scientific American and the New Scientist, which were aimed at a broad readership of scientists, engineers and technologists, three dominant patterns in the construction of the AI myth are identified: (1) the recurrence of analogies and discursive shifts, by which ideas and concepts from other fields were employed to describe the functioning of AI technologies; (2) a rhetorical use of the future, imagining that present shortcomings and limitations will shortly be overcome and (3) the relevance of controversies around the claims of AI, which we argue should be considered as an integral part of the discourse surrounding the AI myth."}, "authors": [{"id": "49518964", "name": "Simone Natale"}, {"id": "1745451", "name": "Andrea Ballatore"}], "fields_of_study": ["Sociology"]}

This research is needed, as the frontier of AI application to decision-making is moving in many management areas from operational to strategic. Given the competitive nature of such decisions and the insights from applying AI to defence and similar areas, it is time to focus on applying AI to strategic marketing decisions.Research limitations/implicationsThe application of AI to strategic marketing decision-making is known to be taking place, but as it is commercially sensitive, data is not available to the authors.Practical implicationsThere are strong implications for all businesses, particularly large businesses in competitive industries, where failure to deploy AI in the face of competition from firms, who have deployed AI to improve their decision-making could be dangerous.Social implicationsThe public sector is a very important marketing decision maker. Although in most cases it does not operate competitively, it must make decisions about making different services available to different citizens and identify the risks of not providing services to certain citizens; so, this paper is relevant to the public sector.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the first papers to probe deployment of AI in strategic marketing decision-making."}, "authors": [{"id": "144294497", "name": "M.

For this reason, differential privacy has been broadly applied in AI but to date, no study has documented which differential privacy mechanisms can or have been leveraged to overcome its issues or the properties that make this possible. In this paper, we show that differential privacy can do more than just privacy preservation. It can also be used to improve security, stabilize learning, build fair models, and impose composition in selected areas of AI.

It is most relevant for the care provider and insurer as well as for the pharmaceutical and medical technology sectors. Although the broad economic impact of digital health solutions in general has been assessed many times in literature and the benefit for patients and society has also been analyzed, the specific economic impact of AI in health care has been addressed only sporadically. Objective This study aimed to systematically review and summarize the cost-effectiveness studies dedicated to AI in health care and to assess whether they meet the established quality criteria. Methods In a first step, the quality criteria for economic impact studies were defined based on the established and adapted criteria schemes for cost impact assessments. In a second step, a systematic literature review based on qualitative and quantitative inclusion and exclusion criteria was conducted to identify relevant publications for an in-depth analysis of the economic impact assessment. In a final step, the quality of the identified economic impact studies was evaluated based on the defined quality criteria for cost-effectiveness studies. Results Very few publications have thoroughly addressed the economic impact assessment, and the economic assessment quality of the reviewed publications on AI shows severe methodological deficits. Only 6 out of 66 publications could be included in the second step of the analysis based on the inclusion criteria. Out of these 6 studies, none comprised a methodologically complete cost impact analysis. There are two areas for improvement in future studies. First, the initial investment and operational costs for the AI infrastructure and service need to be included. Second, alternatives to achieve similar impact must be evaluated to provide a comprehensive comparison. Conclusions This systematic literature analysis proved that the existing impact assessments show methodological deficits and that upcoming evaluations require more comprehensive economic analyses to enable economic decisions for or against implementing AI technology in health care."}, "authors": [{"id": "80646739", "name": "Justus Wolff"}, {"id": "2270764", "name": "J.

Journalistic practice, especially in large-scale economies, is experiencing transformations due to the introduction of automatic artificial intelligence processes into different aspects of news production and dissemination. Now devices and machines are taking on the role of communicator, replacing journalists as communicators. It is important to analyse whether journalism in low income countries has begun to feeling the ripple of artificial intelligence for technologically advanced journalistic practices and newsrooms. Using the Human-Machine Communication framework, this study advances knowledge about what AI can do to transform journalism practice in low-income countries, which is vital to compare the implications of AI in other similar socioeconomic contexts and news media ecologies. Thus, this study specifically reflects upon the case of Pakistan. It investigates how the Pakistani journalists perceive AI technology in the role of communicator and how they view the human-machine communication process. This study identifies constraints and explores opportunities for the use of artificial intelligence in Pakistan’s mainstream news media. To address these aims, this study uses the qualitative method of in-depth interviews, and presents the findings using thematic analysis."}, "authors": [{"id": "86927168", "name": "S.

Although ethics in AI has received significant attention, it remains unclear where the burden of responsibility lies. Through twenty-one interviews with AI practitioners in Australia, this research seeks to understand how ethical attributions figure into the professional imagination. As institutionally embedded technical experts, AI practitioners act as a connective tissue linking the range of actors that come in contact with, and have effects upon, AI products and services. Findings highlight that practitioners distribute ethical responsibility across a range of actors and factors, reserving a portion of responsibility for themselves, albeit constrained. Characterized by imbalances of decision-making power and technical expertise, practitioners position themselves as mediators between powerful bodies that set parameters for production; users who engage with products once they leave the proverbial workbench; and AI systems that evolve and develop beyond practitioner control. Distributing responsibility throughout complex sociotechnical networks, practitioners preclude simple attributions of accountability for the social effects of AI. This indicates that AI ethics are not the purview of any singular player but instead, derive from collectivities that require critical guidance and oversight at all stages of conception, production, distribution, and use."}, "authors": [{"id": "2290306188", "name": "Will Orr"}, {"id": "152658412", "name": "Jenny L.

Purpose To evaluate whether the diagnostic performance of radiologists in the differentiation of cancer from noncancer at dynamic contrast material-enhanced (DCE) breast MRI is improved when using an AI system compared with conventionally available software. Materials and Methods In a retrospective clinical reader study, images from breast DCE MRI examinations were interpreted by 19 breast imaging radiologists from eight academic and 11 private practices. Readers interpreted each examination twice. In the \"first read,\" they were provided with conventionally available computer-aided evaluation software, including kinetic maps. In the \"second read,\" they were also provided with AI analytics through computer-aided diagnosis software. Reader diagnostic performance was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, with the area under the ROC curve (AUC) as a figure of merit in the task of distinguishing between malignant and benign lesions. The primary study end point was the difference in AUC between the first-read and the second-read conditions. Results One hundred eleven women (mean age, 52 years ± 13 [standard deviation]) were evaluated with a total of 111 breast DCE MRI examinations (54 malignant and 57 nonmalignant lesions). The average AUC of all readers improved from 0.71 to 0.76 (P = .04) when using the AI system. The average sensitivity improved when Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 3 was used as the cut point (from 90% to 94%; 95% confidence interval [CI] for the change: 0.8%, 7.4%) but not when using BI-RADS category 4a (from 80% to 85%; 95% CI: -0.9%, 11%). The average specificity showed no difference when using either BI-RADS category 4a or category 3 as the cut point (52% and 52% [95% CI: -7.3%, 6.0%], and from 29% to 28% [95% CI: -6.4%, 4.3%], respectively).

The disease will inevitably place an overwhelming burden on healthcare systems that cannot be effectively dealt with by existing facilities or responses based on conventional approaches. We believe that a rigorous clinical and societal response can only be mounted by using intelligence derived from a variety of data sources to better utilize scarce healthcare resources, provide personalized patient management plans, inform policy, and expedite clinical trials. In this paper, we introduce five of the most important challenges in responding to COVID-19 and show how each of them can be addressed by recent developments in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). We argue that the integration of these techniques into local, national, and international healthcare systems will save lives, and propose specific methods by which implementation can happen swiftly and efficiently.

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems based on deep learning can achieve pathologist-level performance at Gleason grading. However, the performance of such systems can degrade in the presence of artifacts, foreign tissue, or other anomalies. Pathologists integrating their expertise with feedback from an AI system could result in a synergy that outperforms both the individual pathologist and the system. Despite the hype around AI assistance, existing literature on this topic within the pathology domain is limited. We investigated the value of AI assistance for grading prostate biopsies. A panel of 14 observers graded 160 biopsies with and without AI assistance. Using AI, the agreement of the panel with an expert reference standard increased significantly (quadratically weighted Cohen’s kappa, 0.799 vs. 0.872; p  = 0.019). On an external validation set of 87 cases, the panel showed a significant increase in agreement with a panel of international experts in prostate pathology (quadratically weighted Cohen’s kappa, 0.733 vs. 0.786; p  = 0.003). In both experiments, on a group-level, AI-assisted pathologists outperformed the unassisted pathologists and the standalone AI system.

The two main approaches to treating it in the United States are active surveillance versus the surgical option of radical prostatectomy. Your physician recommends the surgical option, and spends considerable time explaining the steps in the surgery, the benefits of (among other things) eliminating the tumor and the risks of (among other things) erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence after the surgery. What your physician does not tell you is that she has arrived at her recommendation of prostatectomy over active surveillance based on the analysis of an Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) system, which recommended this treatment plan based on analysis of your age, tumor size, and other personal characteristics found in your electronic health record. Has the doctor secured informed consent from a legal perspective? From an ethical perspective? If the doctor actually chose to “overrule” the AI system, and the doctor fails to tell you that, has she violated your legal or ethical right to informed consent? If you were to find out that the AI/ML system was used to make recommendations on your care and no one told you, how would you feel? Well, come to think of it, do you know whether an AI/ML system was used the last time you saw a physician? \n \nThis Article, part of a Symposium in the Georgetown Law Journal, is the first to examine in depth how medical AI/ML interfaces with our concept of informed consent. Part I provides a brief primer on medical Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Part II sets out the core and penumbra of U.S. informed consent law and then seeks to determine to what extent AI/ML involvement in a patient’s health should be disclosed under the current doctrine. Part III examines whether the current doctrine “has it right,” examining more openly empirical and normative approaches to the question. \n \nTo forefront my conclusions: while there is some play in the joints, my best reading of the existing legal doctrine is that in general, liability will not lie for failing to inform patients about the use of medical AI/ML to help formulate treatment recommendations. There are a few situations where the doctrine may be more capacious, which I try to draw out (such as when patients inquire, when the medical AI/ML is more opaque, when it is given an outsized role in the final decision-making, or when the AI/ML is used to reduce costs rather than improve patient health), though extending it even here is not certain. I also offer some thoughts on the question: if there is room in the doctrine (either via common law or legislative action), what would it be desirable for the doctrine to look like when it comes to medical AI/ML? I also briefly touch on the question of how the doctrine of informed consent should interact with concerns about biased training data for AI/ML."}, "authors": [{"id": "2180931625", "name": "I.

The philosophical premise is as follows: when clinical data are used to provide care, the primary purpose for acquiring the data is fulfilled. At that point, clinical data should be treated as a form of public good, to be used for the benefit of future patients. In their 2013 article, Faden et al argued that all who participate in the health care system, including patients, have a moral obligation to contribute to improving that system. The authors extend that framework to questions surrounding the secondary use of clinical data for AI applications. Specifically, the authors propose that all individuals and entities with access to clinical data become data stewards, with fiduciary (or trust) responsibilities to patients to carefully safeguard patient privacy, and to the public to ensure that the data are made widely available for the development of knowledge and tools to benefit future patients. According to this framework, the authors maintain that it is unethical for providers to \"sell\" clinical data to other parties by granting access to clinical data, especially under exclusive arrangements, in exchange for monetary or in-kind payments that exceed costs. The authors also propose that patient consent is not required before the data are used for secondary purposes when obtaining such consent is prohibitively costly or burdensome, as long as mechanisms are in place to ensure that ethical standards are strictly followed. Rather than debate whether patients or provider organizations \"own\" the data, the authors propose that clinical data are not owned at all in the traditional sense, but rather that all who interact with or control the data have an obligation to ensure that the data are used for the benefit of future patients and society."}, "authors": [{"id": "145758092", "name": "D.

Using a case study based on the flood of Tabasco of 2007 in Mexico, this research identifies solutions based on the use of emergent disruptive technologies. Furthermore, this article argues that the integration of different technologies is essential to deliver real benefits to the humanitarian supply chain. As a result, it proposes a framework to improve the flow of information, products and financial resources in humanitarian supply chains integrating three emergent disruptive technologies; Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain and 3D Printing.

As a result, assumptions about the drivers, challenges, and impacts of AI in government are far from conclusive. By using a case study that involves a large research university in England and two different county councils in a multiyear collaborative project around AI, we study the challenges that interorganizational collaborations face in adopting AI tools and implementing organizational routines to address them. Our findings reveal the most important challenges facing such collaborations: a resistance to sharing data due to privacy and security concerns, insufficient understanding of the required and available data, a lack of alignment between project interests and expectations around data sharing, and a lack of engagement across organizational hierarchy. Organizational routines capable of overcoming such challenges include working on-site, presenting the benefits of data sharing, reframing problems, designating joint appointments and boundary spanners, and connecting participants in the collaboration at all levels around project design and purpose."}, "authors": [{"id": "82664470", "name": "Averill Campion"}, {"id": "1411051174", "name": "Mila Gascó-Hernández"}, {"id": "144923658", "name": "Slava Jankin"}, {"id": "37950806", "name": "M.

This is a self-exploratory study, in which a qualitative approach interview has been conducted with 10 chief librarians/library heads (5 public + 5 private sectors) from universities regarding their views on the adoption of artificial intelligence tools in Pakistani academic libraries. Results are tabulated in a descriptive format. Librarians are aware of AI technologies. Services based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) are used in libraries, e.g. Google Assistant, Voice Searching, and Google Translate. Pattern recognition methods, such as text data mining, are also used to retrieve library material and conduct online searching. Big data is accessed via services such as cloud computing, OneDrive, and Google Drive. There is a very low level of awareness of robotics and chatbots. This study provides librarians with suggestions as to how AI tools could be used in libraries which either have yet to adopt AI technologies or wish to implement more advanced tools. Pakistani library schools could collaborate with computer science departments to establish AI Labs in the respective library and information science (LIS) departments/libraries.

We sought to characterize the value of AI–enabled electrocardiography (AI-ECG) as a predictor of future AF and assess its performance compared with the CHARGE-AF score (Cohorts for Aging and Research in Genomic Epidemiology–AF) in a population-based sample. Methods: We calculated the probability of AF using AI-ECG, among participants in the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging who had no history of AF at the time of the baseline study visit. Cox proportional hazards models were fit to assess the independent prognostic value and interaction between AI-ECG AF model output and CHARGE-AF score. C statistics were calculated for AI-ECG AF model output, CHARGE-AF score, and combined AI-ECG and CHARGE-AF score. Results: A total of 1936 participants with median age 75.8 (interquartile range, 70.4–81.8) years and median CHARGE-AF score 14.0 (IQR, 13.2–14.7) were included in the analysis. Participants with AI-ECG AF model output of >0.5 at the baseline visit had cumulative incidence of AF 21.5% at 2 years and 52.2% at 10 years. When included in the same model, both AI-ECG AF model output (hazard ratio, 1.76 per SD after logit transformation [95% CI, 1.51–2.04]) and CHARGE-AF score (hazard ratio, 1.90 per SD [95% CI, 1.58–2.28]) independently predicted future AF without significant interaction (P=0.54). C statistics were 0.69 (95% CI, 0.66–0.72) for AI-ECG AF model output, 0.69 (95% CI, 0.66–0.71) for CHARGE-AF, and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.69–0.75) for combined AI-ECG and CHARGE-AF score. Conclusions: In the present study, both the AI-ECG AF model output and CHARGE-AF score independently predicted incident AF.

This debate article discusses whether artificial intelligence health monitoring may be suitable enhancement or replacement for elder care. Main text Internationally, as life expectancy continues to rise, many countries are facing a severe shortage of direct care workers. The health workforce is aging, and replacement remains a challenge. Artificial intelligence health monitoring technologies may play a novel and significant role in filling the human resource gaps in caring for older adults by complementing current care provision, reducing the burden on family caregivers, and improving the quality of care. Nonetheless, opportunities brought on by these emerging technologies raise ethical questions that must be addressed to ensure that these automated systems can truly enhance care and health outcomes for older adults. This debate article explores some ethical dimensions of using automated health monitoring technologies. It argues that, in order for these health monitoring technologies to fulfill the wishes of older adults to age in place and also to empower them and improve their quality of life, we need deep knowledge of how stakeholders may balance their considerations of relational care, safety, and privacy. Conclusion It is only when we design artificial intelligence health monitoring technologies with intersecting clinical and ethical factors in mind that the resulting systems will enhance productive relational care, facilitate independent living, promote older adults’ health outcomes, and minimize waste."}, "authors": [{"id": "145057310", "name": "A.

One of the main strategies is to screen 70% of women at the age between 35 and 45 years and 90% of women managed appropriately by 2030. So far, approximately 85% of cervical cancers occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The colposcopy-guided biopsy is crucial for detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and becomes the main bottleneck limiting screening performance. Unprecedented advances in artificial intelligence (AI) enable the synergy of deep learning and digital colposcopy, which offers opportunities for automatic image-based diagnosis. To this end, we discuss the main challenges of traditional colposcopy and the solutions applying AI-guided digital colposcopy as an auxiliary diagnostic tool in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs). Main body Existing challenges for the application of colposcopy in LMICs include strong dependence on the subjective experience of operators, substantial inter- and intra-operator variabilities, shortage of experienced colposcopists, consummate colposcopy training courses, and uniform diagnostic standard and strict quality control that are hard to be followed by colposcopists with limited diagnostic ability, resulting in discrepant reporting and documentation of colposcopy impressions. Organized colposcopy training courses should be viewed as an effective way to enhance the diagnostic ability of colposcopists, but implementing these courses in practice may not always be feasible to improve the overall diagnostic performance in a short period of time. Fortunately, AI has the potential to address colposcopic bottleneck, which could assist colposcopists in colposcopy imaging judgment, detection of underlying CINs, and guidance of biopsy sites. The automated workflow of colposcopy examination could create a novel cervical cancer screening model, reduce potentially false negatives and false positives, and improve the accuracy of colposcopy diagnosis and cervical biopsy. Conclusion We believe that a practical and accurate AI-guided digital colposcopy has the potential to strengthen the diagnostic ability in guiding cervical biopsy, thereby improves cervical cancer screening performance in LMICs and accelerates the process of global cervical cancer elimination eventually."}, "authors": [{"id": "2063084926", "name": "P.

The reasons for dyspnea are often multifactorial. A focused physical evaluation and diagnostic testing can lack sensitivity and specificity. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of an artificial intelligence-enabled ECG to identify patients presenting with dyspnea who have left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). Methods: We retrospectively applied a validated artificial intelligence-enabled ECG algorithm for the identification of LVSD (defined as LV ejection fraction ≤35%) to a cohort of patients aged ≥18 years who were evaluated in the ED at a Mayo Clinic site with dyspnea. Patients were included if they had at least one standard 12-lead ECG acquired on the date of the ED visit and an echocardiogram performed within 30 days of presentation. Patients with prior LVSD were excluded. We assessed the model performance using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Results: A total of 1606 patients were included. Median time from ECG to echocardiogram was 1 day (Q1: 1, Q3: 2). The artificial intelligence-enabled ECG algorithm identified LVSD with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.86–0.91) and accuracy of 85.9%. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value were 74%, 87%, 97%, and 40%, respectively. To identify an ejection fraction <50%, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.85 (95% CI, 0.83–0.88), 86%, 63%, and 91%, respectively. NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) alone at a cutoff of >800 identified LVSD with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.76–0.84). Conclusions: The ECG is an inexpensive, ubiquitous, painless test which can be quickly obtained in the ED. It effectively identifies LVSD in selected patients presenting to the ED with dyspnea when analyzed with artificial intelligence and outperforms NT-proBNP."}, "authors": [{"id": "3572759", "name": "Demilade A.

Typically, nonspecialists such as dentists screen for oral cancer risk, and then they refer high-risk patients to specialists for biopsy-based diagnosis. Because the clinical appearance of oral mucosal lesions is not an adequate indicator of their diagnosis, status, or risk level, this initial triage process is inaccurate, with poor sensitivity and specificity. The objective of this study is to provide an overview of emerging optical imaging modalities and novel artificial intelligence–based approaches, as well as to evaluate their individual and combined utility and implications for improving oral cancer detection and outcomes. The principles of image-based approaches to detecting oral cancer are placed within the context of clinical needs and parameters. A brief overview of artificial intelligence approaches and algorithms is presented, and studies that use these 2 approaches singly and together are cited and evaluated. In recent years, a range of novel imaging modalities has been investigated for their applicability to improving oral cancer outcomes, yet none of them have found widespread adoption or significantly affected clinical practice or outcomes. Artificial intelligence approaches are beginning to have considerable impact in improving diagnostic accuracy in some fields of medicine, but to date, only limited studies apply to oral cancer. These studies demonstrate that artificial intelligence approaches combined with imaging can have considerable impact on oral cancer outcomes, with applications ranging from low-cost screening with smartphone-based probes to algorithm-guided detection of oral lesion heterogeneity and margins using optical coherence tomography. Combined imaging and artificial intelligence approaches can improve oral cancer outcomes through improved detection and diagnosis."}, "authors": [{"id": "12281181", "name": "B.

Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and reading time were assessed as endpoints.\n\n\nResults\nThe average AUC across readers was 0.769 (95% CI: 0.724, 0.814) without AI and 0.797 (95% CI: 0.754, 0.840) with AI. The average difference in AUC was 0.028 (95% CI: 0.002, 0.055, P = .035). Average sensitivity was increased by 0.033 when using AI support (P = .021). Reading time changed dependently to the AI-tool score. For low likelihood of malignancy (< 2.5%), the time was about the same in the first reading session and slightly decreased in the second reading session. For higher likelihood of malignancy, the reading time was on average increased with the use of AI.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis clinical investigation demonstrated that the concurrent use of this AI tool improved the diagnostic performance of radiologists in the detection of breast cancer without prolonging their workflow.Supplemental material is available for this article.© RSNA, 2020."}, "authors": [{"id": "2113185", "name": "S.

A detailed analysis of those articles was conducted in order to classify most used AI techniques for medical diagnostic systems. We further discuss various diseases along with corresponding techniques of AI, including Fuzzy Logic, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. This research paper aims to reveal some important insights into current and previous different AI techniques in the medical field used in today’s medical research, particularly in heart disease prediction, brain disease, prostate, liver disease, and kidney disease.

Therefore, we conduct an experiment to examine how algorithm aversion manifests in auditor judgments. Consistent with theory, we find that auditors receiving contradictory evidence from their firm’s specialist system (instead of a human specialist) propose smaller adjustments to management’s complex estimates, particularly when management develops their estimates using relatively objective (versus subjective) inputs.

To support this, both researchers and practitioners need to be familiar with current methods of ensuring cybersecurity (CyberSec). In particular, the use of artificial intelligence for combating cybercrimes. However, there is lack of summaries on artificial intelligent methods for combating cybercrimes. To address this knowledge gap, this study sampled 131 articles from two main scholarly databases (ACM digital library and IEEE Xplore). Using a systematic mapping, the articles were analyzed using quantitative and qualitative methods. It was observed that artificial intelligent methods have made remarkable contributions to combating cybercrimes with significant improvement in intrusion detection systems. It was also observed that there is a reduction in computational complexity, model training times and false alarms. However, there is a significant skewness within the domain. Most studies have focused on intrusion detection and prevention systems, and the most dominant technique used was support vector machines. The findings also revealed that majority of the studies were published in two journal outlets. It is therefore suggested that to enhance research in artificial intelligence for CyberSec, researchers need to adopt newer techniques and also publish in other related outlets."}, "authors": [{"id": "1736502", "name": "I.

While digital imagery has greatly improved the speed of underwater data collection for monitoring benthic communities, image analysis remains a bottleneck in reporting observations. In recent years, a rapid evolution of artificial intelligence in image recognition has been evident in its broad applications in modern society, offering new opportunities for increasing the capabilities of coral reef monitoring. Here, we evaluated the performance of Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks for automated image analysis, using a global coral reef monitoring dataset. The study demonstrates the advantages of automated image analysis for coral reef monitoring in terms of error and repeatability of benthic abundance estimations, as well as cost and benefit. We found unbiased and high agreement between expert and automated observations (97%). Repeated surveys and comparisons against existing monitoring programs also show that automated estimation of benthic composition is equally robust in detecting change and ensuring the continuity of existing monitoring data. Using this automated approach, data analysis and reporting can be accelerated by at least 200x and at a fraction of the cost (1%). Combining commonly used underwater imagery in monitoring with automated image annotation can dramatically improve how we measure and monitor coral reefs worldwide, particularly in terms of allocating limited resources, rapid reporting and data integration within and across management areas."}, "authors": [{"id": "1402006589", "name": "Manuel González-Rivero"}, {"id": "3258919", "name": "Oscar Beijbom"}, {"id": "1403117885", "name": "Alberto Rodriguez-Ramirez"}, {"id": "32302942", "name": "Dominic E.

We first analyse a range of public documents to identify the key actors, mechanisms and issues which structure societal expectations around artificial intelligence (AI) and an emerging discourse on ethics. We then explore expectations of AI and ethics through a survey of members of the public. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the role of AI in communication governance. We find that, despite societal expectations that we can design ethical AI, and public expectations that developers and governments should share responsibility for the outcomes of AI use, there is a significant divergence between these expectations and the ways in which AI technologies are currently used and governed in large scale communication systems. We conclude that discourses of ‘ethical AI’ are generically performative, but to become more effective we need to acknowledge the limitations of contemporary AI and the requirement for extensive human labour to meet the challenges of communication governance. An effective ethics of AI requires domain appropriate AI tools, updated professional practices, dignified places of work and robust regulatory and accountability frameworks."}, "authors": [{"id": "36029688", "name": "Aphra Kerr"}, {"id": "34810113", "name": "Marguerite Barry"}, {"id": "34967075", "name": "John D.

The use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) based on ICTs reduces the risk of accidents in the workplace, thanks to the capacity of the equipment to make decisions on the basis of environmental factors. Paradigms such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) make it possible to generate PPE models feasibly and create devices with more advanced characteristics such as monitoring, sensing the environment and risk detection between others. The working environment is monitored continuously by these models and they notify the employees and their supervisors of any anomalies and threats. This paper presents a smart helmet prototype that monitors the conditions in the workers’ environment and performs a near real-time evaluation of risks. The data collected by sensors is sent to an AI-driven platform for analysis. The training dataset consisted of 11,755 samples and 12 different scenarios. As part of this research, a comparative study of the state-of-the-art models of supervised learning is carried out. Moreover, the use of a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is proposed for the detection of possible occupational risks.

Massive digital transformations are affecting the economies of those countries and are bringing with them many promised merits, as well as many challenges to face. This paper aims to examine the relationship between digital transformation (as a one facet of the fourth revolution and AI trends) on one side, and economic development, labor productivity and employment on the other side.Design/methodology/approachThe paper analyzes different indices of digital transformation, and then uses the Digital Evolution Index (DEI) to study those relationships in a group of developing countries using feasible generalized least squares method (FGLS).FindingsThe results show a positive relationship between the digital transformation index and economic development, labor productivity and job employment. Females seem to gain more from digital transformation compared to males, as suggested by the positive relation with the first and the insignificant relation with the latter. The relationship with vulnerable employment is not significant; more evidence is still needed to judge whether digital transformation will have an impact upon the vulnerable employees in the economy.Research limitations/implicationsThe paper focused on the impact of digital transformation upon total aggregate employment. Future research is still needed to examine the impact upon the structure of the labor market and the shift of occupations.Originality/valueThe paper aims to add to in the literature regarding the relationship between digital transformation, economic development, employment and productivity in the developing world. The implications of those relationships are of significant importance to policymakers regarding how much support should be given to encourage the digital transformation. At the same time, it shall also indicate how much social support policies are required – if any – to lessen the negative impact of digital transformation on the vulnerable groups inside the country. Another contribution is using a single composite index for digital transformation that is comparable across the chosen set of developing countries, instead of using single indices each capturing a different dimension of digital transformation."}, "authors": [{"id": "122625035", "name": "Heidi Aly"}], "fields_of_study": ["Economics"]}

Across multiple studies (total N = 1,668), we showed that these construal-based differences affect compliance with persuasive messages made by artificial agents. These messages are more appropriate and effective when the message represents low-level as opposed to high-level construal features.

Objectives: Early detection of sepsis is critical in clinical practice since each hour of delayed treatment has been associated with an increase in mortality due to irreversible organ damage. This study aimed to develop an explainable artificial intelligence model for early predicting sepsis by analyzing the electronic health record data from ICU provided by the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019. Design: Retrospective observational study. Setting: We developed our model on the shared ICUs publicly data and verified on the full hidden populations for challenge scoring. Patients: Public database included 40,336 patients’ electronic health records sourced from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (hospital system A) and Emory University Hospital (hospital system B). A total of 24,819 patients from hospital systems A, B, and C (an unidentified hospital system) were sequestered as full hidden test sets. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 168 features were extracted on hourly basis. Explainable artificial intelligence sepsis predictor model was trained to predict sepsis in real time. Impact of each feature on hourly sepsis prediction was explored in-depth to show the interpretability. The algorithm demonstrated the final clinical utility score of 0.364 in this challenge when tested on the full hidden test sets, and the scores on three separate test sets were 0.430, 0.422, and –0.048, respectively.

On one hand, AI can make database more intelligent (AI4DB). For example, traditional empirical database optimization techniques (e.g., cost estimation, join order selection, knob tuning, index and view selection) cannot meet the high-performance requirement for large-scale database instances, various applications and diversified users, especially on the cloud. Fortunately, learning-based techniques can alleviate this problem. On the other hand, database techniques can optimize AI models (DB4AI). For example, AI is hard to deploy in real applications, because it requires developers to write complex codes and train complicated models. Database techniques can be used to reduce the complexity of using AI models, accelerate AI algorithms and provide AI capability inside databases. Thus both DB4AI and AI4DB have been extensively studied recently. In this article, we review existing studies on AI4DB and DB4AI. For AI4DB, we review the techniques on learning-based configuration tuning, optimizer, index/view advisor, and security. For DB4AI, we review AI-oriented declarative language, AI-oriented data governance, training acceleration, and inference acceleration.

We provide a comprehensive picture of the use of AI technologies and their impact among US firms over the last decade, using a unique combination of job postings and individual-level employment profiles. We introduce a novel measure of investments in AI technologies based on human capital and document that larger firms with higher sales, markups, and cash holdings tend to invest more in AI. Firms that invest in AI experience faster growth in both sales and employment, which translates into analogous growth at the industry level. The positive effects are concentrated among the ex ante largest firms, leading to a positive correlation between AI investments and an increase in industry concentration. However, the increase in concentration is not accompanied by either increased markups or increased productivity. Instead, firms tend to expand into new product and geographic markets. Our results are robust to instrumenting firm-level AI investments with foreign industry-level AI investments and with local variation in industry-level AI investments, and to controlling for investments in general information technology and robotics. We also document consistent patterns across measures of AI using firms' demand for AI talent (job postings) and actual AI talent (resumes).

Methods In this retrospective study, 9581 double-read mammography screening exams including 68 screen-detected cancers and 187 false positives, a subcohort of the prospective population-based Malmö Breast Tomosynthesis Screening Trial, were analysed with a deep learning–based AI system. The AI system categorises mammograms with a cancer risk score increasing from 1 to 10. The effect on cancer detection and false positives of excluding mammograms below different AI risk thresholds from reading by radiologists was investigated. A panel of three breast radiologists assessed the radiographic appearance, type, and visibility of screen-detected cancers assigned low-risk scores (≤ 5). The reduction of normal exams, cancers, and false positives for the different thresholds was presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results If mammograms scored 1 and 2 were excluded from screen-reading, 1829 (19.1%; 95% CI 18.3–19.9) exams could be removed, including 10 (5.3%; 95% CI 2.1–8.6) false positives but no cancers. In total, 5082 (53.0%; 95% CI 52.0–54.0) exams, including 7 (10.3%; 95% CI 3.1–17.5) cancers and 52 (27.8%; 95% CI 21.4–34.2) false positives, had low-risk scores. All, except one, of the seven screen-detected cancers with low-risk scores were judged to be clearly visible. Conclusions The evaluated AI system can correctly identify a proportion of a screening population as cancer-free and also reduce false positives. Thus, AI has the potential to improve mammography screening efficiency. Key Points • Retrospective study showed that AI can identify a proportion of mammograms as normal in a screening population. • Excluding normal exams from screening using AI can reduce false positives."}, "authors": [{"id": "39587174", "name": "K.

For this purpose, an ever-increasing amount of data has to be collected, analyzed, and interpreted. Still, a major part of these activities is performed manually, which requires high investments in various resources. To support these processes more efficiently, this article presents an artificial-intelligence-based data mining model that helps firms spot emerging topics and trends at a higher level of automation than before. Its modular structure consists of components for query generation, data collection, data preprocessing, topic modeling, topic analysis, and visualization, combined in such a way that only a minimum amount of manual effort is required during its initial set up. The approach also incorporates self-adaptive capabilities, allowing the model to automatically update itself once new data has become available. The model parameterization is based on latest research in this area, and its threshold parameter is learnt during supervised training using a training data set. We have applied our model to an independent test data set to verify its effectiveness as an early warning system. By means of a retrospective analysis, we show in three case studies that our model is able to identify emerging technologies prior to their first publication in the Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies.

This paper offers a new perspective on whether, and how, AI can be employed in coaching as a key HRD tool. We provide a definition of the concept of AI coaching and differentiate it from related concepts. We also challenge the assumption that AI coaching is feasible by challenging its capability to lead through a systematic coaching process and to establish a working alliance to clients. Based on these evaluations, AI coaching seems to encounter the greatest difficulties in the clients’ problem identification and in delivering individual feedback, which may limit its effectiveness. However, AI generally appears capable of guiding clients through many steps in the coaching process and establishing working alliances. We offer specific recommendations for HRD professionals and organizations, coaches, and developers of AI coaching programs on how AI coaching can contribute to enhance coaching practice. Combined with its lower costs and wider target group, AI coaching will likely transform the coaching profession and provide a future HRD tool."}, "authors": [{"id": "51140054", "name": "C.

AI is gradually going to be used to perform tasks, including identity checks, border security and control, and analysis of data about visa and asylum applicants. To an extent, this is already a reality in some countries such as Canada, which uses algorithmic decision-making in immigration and asylum determination, and Germany, which has piloted projects using technologies such as face and dialect recognition for decision-making in asylum determination processes. The article’s central hypothesis is that AI technology can affect international migration management in three different dimensions: (1) by deepening the existing asymmetries between states on the international plane; (2) by modernising states’ and international organisations’ traditional practices; and (3) by reinforcing the contemporary calls for more evidence-based migration management and border security. The article examines each of these three hypotheses and reflects on the main challenges of using AI solutions for international migration management. It draws on legal, political and technology-facing academic literature, examining the current trends in technological developments and investigating the consequences that these can have for international migration. Most particularly, the article contributes to the current debate about the future of international migration management, informing policymakers in this area of growing importance and fast development."}, "authors": [{"id": "80730587", "name": "A.

The impact of AI on health outcomes and inequalities calls for health professionals and data scientists to make a collaborative effort to ensure historic health disparities are not encoded into the future. We present a study that evaluates bias in existing Natural Language Processing (NLP) models used in psychiatry and discuss how these biases may widen health inequalities. Our approach systematically evaluates each stage of model development to explore how biases arise from a clinical, data science and linguistic perspective. Design/Methods A literature review of the uses of NLP in mental health was carried out across multiple disciplinary databases with defined Mesh terms and keywords. Our primary analysis evaluated biases within ‘GloVe’ and ‘Word2Vec’ word embeddings. Euclidean distances were measured to assess relationships between psychiatric terms and demographic labels, and vector similarity functions were used to solve analogy questions relating to mental health. Results Our primary analysis of mental health terminology in GloVe and Word2Vec embeddings demonstrated significant biases with respect to religion, race, gender, nationality, sexuality and age. Our literature review returned 52 papers, of which none addressed all the areas of possible bias that we identify in model development. In addition, only one article existed on more than one research database, demonstrating the isolation of research within disciplinary silos and inhibiting cross-disciplinary collaboration or communication. Conclusion Our findings are relevant to professionals who wish to minimize the health inequalities that may arise as a result of AI and data-driven algorithms. We offer primary research identifying biases within these technologies and provide recommendations for avoiding these harms in the future."}, "authors": [{"id": "51987097", "name": "Isabel Straw"}, {"id": "1763608", "name": "Chris Callison-Burch"}], "fields_of_study": ["Medicine", "Psychology"]}

AI-CDSS for cardiology was developed with a hybrid (expert-driven and machine-learning-driven) approach of knowledge acquisition to evolve the knowledge base with heart failure diagnosis. A retrospective cohort of 1198 patients with and without heart failure was used for the development of AI-CDSS (training dataset, n  = 600) and to test the performance (test dataset, n  = 598). A prospective clinical pilot study of 97 patients with dyspnea was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of AI-CDSS compared with that of non-heart failure specialists. The concordance rate between AI-CDSS and heart failure specialists was evaluated. In retrospective cohort, the concordance rate was 98.3% in the test dataset. The concordance rate for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and no heart failure was 100%, 100%, 99.6%, and 91.7%, respectively. In a prospective pilot study of 97 patients presenting with dyspnea to the outpatient clinic, 44% had heart failure. The concordance rate between AI-CDSS and heart failure specialists was 98%, whereas that between non-heart failure specialists and heart failure specialists was 76%.

However, CMR suffers from long acquisition times due to the need of obtaining images with high temporal and spatial resolution, different contrasts, and/or whole-heart coverage. In addition, both cardiac and respiratory-induced motion of the heart during the acquisition need to be accounted for, further increasing the scan time. Several undersampling reconstruction techniques have been proposed during the last decades to speed up CMR acquisition. These techniques rely on acquiring less data than needed and estimating the non-acquired data exploiting some sort of prior information. Parallel imaging and compressed sensing undersampling reconstruction techniques have revolutionized the field, enabling 2- to 3-fold scan time accelerations to become standard in clinical practice. Recent scientific advances in CMR reconstruction hinge on the thriving field of artificial intelligence. Machine learning reconstruction approaches have been recently proposed to learn the non-linear optimization process employed in CMR reconstruction. Unlike analytical methods for which the reconstruction problem is explicitly defined into the optimization process, machine learning techniques make use of large data sets to learn the key reconstruction parameters and priors. In particular, deep learning techniques promise to use deep neural networks (DNN) to learn the reconstruction process from existing datasets in advance, providing a fast and efficient reconstruction that can be applied to all newly acquired data. However, before machine learning and DNN can realize their full potentials and enter widespread clinical routine for CMR image reconstruction, there are several technical hurdles that need to be addressed. In this article, we provide an overview of the recent developments in the area of artificial intelligence for CMR image reconstruction. The underlying assumptions of established techniques such as compressed sensing and low-rank reconstruction are briefly summarized, while a greater focus is given to recent advances in dictionary learning and deep learning based CMR reconstruction. In particular, approaches that exploit neural networks as implicit or explicit priors are discussed for 2D dynamic cardiac imaging and 3D whole-heart CMR imaging. Current limitations, challenges, and potential future directions of these techniques are also discussed."}, "authors": [{"id": "1691643", "name": "Aurélien Bustin"}, {"id": "2610845", "name": "N.

Dentistry is no exception to this trend, and the applications of artificial intelligence are particularly promising in the field of oral and maxillofacial (OMF) radiology. Recent researches on artificial intelligence in OMF radiology have mainly used convolutional neural networks, which can perform image classification, detection, segmentation, registration, generation, and refinement. Artificial intelligence systems in this field have been developed for the purposes of radiographic diagnosis, image analysis, forensic dentistry, and image quality improvement. Tremendous amounts of data are needed to achieve good results, and involvement of OMF radiologist is essential for making accurate and consistent data sets, which is a time-consuming task. In order to widely use artificial intelligence in actual clinical practice in the future, there are lots of problems to be solved, such as building up a huge amount of fine-labeled open data set, understanding of the judgment criteria of artificial intelligence, and DICOM hacking threats using artificial intelligence. If solutions to these problems are presented with the development of artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence will develop further in the future and is expected to play an important role in the development of automatic diagnosis systems, the establishment of treatment plans, and the fabrication of treatment tools. OMF radiologists, as professionals who thoroughly understand the characteristics of radiographic images, will play a very important role in the development of artificial intelligence applications in this field."}, "authors": [{"id": "2319533", "name": "M.

Objective To address this global health crisis, artificial intelligence (AI) has been deployed at various levels of the health care system. However, AI has both potential benefits and limitations. We therefore conducted a review of AI applications for COVID-19. Methods We performed an extensive search of the PubMed and EMBASE databases for COVID-19–related English-language studies published between December 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020. We supplemented the database search with reference list checks. A thematic analysis and narrative review of AI applications for COVID-19 was conducted. Results In total, 11 papers were included for review. AI was applied to COVID-19 in four areas: diagnosis, public health, clinical decision making, and therapeutics. We identified several limitations including insufficient data, omission of multimodal methods of AI-based assessment, delay in realization of benefits, poor internal/external validation, inability to be used by laypersons, inability to be used in resource-poor settings, presence of ethical pitfalls, and presence of legal barriers. AI could potentially be explored in four other areas: surveillance, combination with big data, operation of other core clinical services, and management of patients with COVID-19. Conclusions In view of the continuing increase in the number of cases, and given that multiple waves of infections may occur, there is a need for effective methods to help control the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its shortcomings, AI holds the potential to greatly augment existing human efforts, which may otherwise be overwhelmed by high patient numbers."}, "authors": [{"id": "2108328038", "name": "Jiayang Chen"}, {"id": "4822484", "name": "K.

The paper evaluates current legal protection in Europe against discriminatory algorithmic decisions. The paper shows that non-discrimination law, in particular through the concept of indirect discrimination, prohibits many types of algorithmic discrimination. Data protection law could also help to defend people against discrimination. Proper enforcement of non-discrimination law and data protection law could help to protect people. However, the paper shows that both legal instruments have severe weaknesses when applied to artificial intelligence. The paper suggests how enforcement of current rules can be improved. The paper also explores whether additional rules are needed.

DeepSPM is able to acquire and classify data continuously in multi-day scanning tunneling microscopy experiments, managing the probe quality in response to varying experimental conditions.

The literature presented various applications, systems, or methods and reported the results of using IoT, artificial intelligence (AI), and geographic information system (GIS) at homes. Because the technology has been advancing and users are experiencing IoT boom for smart built environment applications, especially smart homes and smart energy systems, it is necessary to identify the gaps, relation between current methods, and provide a coherent instruction of the whole process of designing smart homes. This article reviewed relevant papers within databases, such as Scopus, including journal papers published in between 2010 and 2019. These papers were then analyzed in terms of bibliography and content to identify more related systems, practices, and contributors. A designed systematic review method was used to identify and select the relevant papers, which were then reviewed for their content by means of coding. The presented systematic critical review focuses on systems developed and technologies used for smart homes. The main question is ”What has been learned from a decade trailing smart system developments in different fields?”. We found that there is a considerable gap in the integration of AI and IoT and the use of geospatial data in smart home development. It was also found that there is a large gap in the literature in terms of limited integrated systems for energy efficiency and aged care system development. This article would enable researchers and professionals to fully understand those gaps in IoT-based environments and suggest ways to fill the gaps while designing smart homes where users have a higher level of thermal comfort while saving energy and greenhouse gas emissions. This article also raised new challenging questions on how IoT and existing developed systems could be improved and be further developed to address other issues of energy saving, which can steer the research direction to full smart systems. This would significantly help to design fully automated assistive systems to improve quality of life and decrease energy consumption."}, "authors": [{"id": "90426770", "name": "S.

To answer this need, here we analyze three key challenges to interdisciplinary AI research, and deliver three broad conclusions: 1) future development of AI should not only impact other scientific domains but should also take inspiration and benefit from other fields of science, 2) AI research must be accompanied by decision explainability, dataset bias transparency as well as development of evaluation methodologies and creation of regulatory agencies to ensure responsibility, and 3) AI education should receive more attention, efforts and innovation from the educational and scientific communities. Our analysis is of interest not only to AI practitioners but also to other researchers and the general public as it offers ways to guide the emerging collaborations and interactions toward the most fruitful outcomes."}, "authors": [{"id": "2007729358", "name": "R.

These requirements pose new challenges that can no longer be efficiently addressed by conventional approaches. Artificial intelligence (AI) is considered as one of the most promising solutions to improve the performance and robustness of 5G and B5G systems, fueled by the massive amount of data generated in 5G and B5G networks and the availability of powerful data processing fabrics.

The key distinction between D.A.I. and ubiquitous stochastic methods for artificial intelligence is the adoption of first principles whenever able (in every instance available). One benefit of applying artificial intelligence principles over ubiquitous methods is the ease of the approach once the re-parameterization is derived, as done here. While the method is deterministic, researchers need only understand linear regression to understand the optimality of both self-awareness and learning. The approach necessitates full (autonomous) expression of a desired trajectory. Inspired by the exponential solution of ordinary differential equations and Euler’s expression of exponential solutions in terms of sinusoidal functions, desired trajectories will be formulated using such functions. Deterministic self-awareness statements, using the autonomous expression of desired trajectories with buoyancy control neglected, are asserted to control underwater vehicles in ideal cases only, while application to real-world deleterious effects is reserved for future study due to the length of this manuscript. In totality, the proposed methodology automates control and learning merely necessitating very simple user inputs, namely desired initial and final states and desired initial and final time, while tuning is eliminated completely."}, "authors": [{"id": "50370717", "name": "Timothy Sands"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Summary Background Data: Many adverse events during surgery occur due to errors in visual perception and judgment leading to misinterpretation of anatomy. Deep learning, a subfield of AI, can potentially be used to provide real-time guidance intraoperatively. Methods: Deep learning models were developed and trained to identify safe (Go) and dangerous (No-Go) zones of dissection, liver, gallbladder, and hepatocystic triangle during LC. Annotations were performed by 4 high-volume surgeons. AI predictions were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation against annotations by expert surgeons. Primary outcomes were intersection- over-union (IOU) and F1 score (validated spatial correlation indices), and secondary outcomes were pixel-wise accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, ± standard deviation. Results: AI models were trained on 2627 random frames from 290 LC videos, procured from 37 countries, 136 institutions, and 153 surgeons. Mean IOU, F1 score, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for the AI to identify Go zones were 0.53 (±0.24), 0.70 (±0.28), 0.94 (±0.05), 0.69 (±0.20). and 0.94 (±0.03), respectively. For No-Go zones, these metrics were 0.71 (±0.29), 0.83 (±0.31), 0.95 (±0.06), 0.80 (±0.21), and 0.98 (±0.05), respectively. Mean IOU for identification of the liver, gallbladder, and hepatocystic triangle were: 0.86 (±0.12), 0.72 (±0.19), and 0.65 (±0.22), respectively. Conclusions: AI can be used to identify anatomy within the surgical field. This technology may eventually be used to provide real-time guidance and minimize the risk of adverse events."}, "authors": [{"id": "13533044", "name": "A.

Many studies have examined the technical performance of AI within an experimental context. These studies provide limited insights into the issues that its use in a real-world context of care and services raises. To help decision makers address these issues in a systemic and holistic manner, this viewpoint paper relies on the health technology assessment core model to contrast the expectations of the health sector toward the use of AI with the risks that should be mitigated for its responsible deployment. The analysis adopts the perspective of payers (ie, health system organizations and agencies) because of their central role in regulating, financing, and reimbursing novel technologies. This paper suggests that AI-based systems should be seen as a health system transformation lever, rather than a discrete set of technological devices. Their use could bring significant changes and impacts at several levels: technological, clinical, human and cognitive (patient and clinician), professional and organizational, economic, legal, and ethical. The assessment of AI’s value proposition should thus go beyond technical performance and cost logic by performing a holistic analysis of its value in a real-world context of care and services. To guide AI development, generate knowledge, and draw lessons that can be translated into action, the right political, regulatory, organizational, clinical, and technological conditions for innovation should be created as a first step."}, "authors": [{"id": "3485143", "name": "H.

After reading a given scenario, participants (N = 284) were asked to assign a level of responsibility to the driver. The participants blamed drivers more when the driver was AI compared to when the driver was a human. Also, the higher level of blame was shown when the result was more severe.

The wider health and cost impact of employing AI for dental diagnostics has not yet been evaluated. We compared the cost-effectiveness of proximal caries detection on bitewing radiographs with versus without AI. U-Net, a fully convolutional neural network, had been trained, validated, and tested on 3,293, 252, and 141 bitewing radiographs, respectively, on which 4 experienced dentists had marked carious lesions (reference test). Lesions were stratified for initial lesions (E1/E2/D1, presumed noncavitated, receiving caries infiltration if detected) and advanced lesions (D2/D3, presumed cavitated, receiving restorative care if detected). A Markov model was used to simulate the consequences of true- and false-positive and true- and false-negative detections, as well as the subsequent decisions over the lifetime of patients. A German mixed-payers perspective was adopted. Our health outcome was tooth retention years. Costs were measured in 2020 euro. Monte-Carlo microsimulations and univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and the cost-effectiveness acceptability at different willingness-to-pay thresholds were quantified. AI showed an accuracy of 0.80; dentists’ mean accuracy was significantly lower at 0.71 (minimum–maximum: 0.61–0.78, P < 0.05). AI was significantly more sensitive than dentists (0.75 vs. 0.36 [0.19–0.65]; P = 0.006), while its specificity was not significantly lower (0.83 vs. 0.91 [0.69–0.98]; P > 0.05). In the base-case scenario, AI was more effective (tooth retention for a mean 64 [2.5%–97.5%: 61–65] y) and less costly (298 [244–367] euro) than assessment without AI (62 [59–64] y; 322 [257–394] euro). The ICER was −13.9 euro/y (i.e., AI saved money at higher effectiveness). In the majority (>77%) of all cases, AI was less costly and more effective. Applying AI for caries detection is likely to be cost-effective, mainly as fewer lesions remain undetected.

A dysregulated metabolism induces the secretion of several molecules which in turn trigger the inflammatory pathway. Inflammation is the natural reaction of the immune system to a variety of stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, and harmful substances. Metabolically triggered inflammation, also called metaflammation or low-grade chronic inflammation, is the consequence of a synergic interaction between the host and the exposome—a combination of environmental drivers, including diet, lifestyle, pollutants and other factors throughout the life span of an individual. Various levels of chronic inflammation are associated with several lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes, obesity, metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), cancers, cardiovascular disorders (CVDs), autoimmune diseases, and chronic lung diseases. Chronic diseases are a growing concern worldwide, placing a heavy burden on individuals, families, governments, and health-care systems. New strategies are needed to empower communities worldwide to prevent and treat these diseases. Precision medicine provides a model for the next generation of lifestyle modification. This will capitalize on the dynamic interaction between an individual’s biology, lifestyle, behavior, and environment. The aim of precision medicine is to design and improve diagnosis, therapeutics and prognostication through the use of large complex datasets that incorporate individual gene, function, and environmental variations. The implementation of high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) can predict risks with greater accuracy based on available multidimensional clinical and biological datasets.

Over 40% of people with T1D manage their glucose through multiple injections of long-acting basal and short-acting bolus insulin, so-called multiple daily injections (MDI)1,2. Errors in dosing can lead to life-threatening hypoglycaemia events (<70 mg dl−1) and hyperglycaemia (>180 mg dl−1), increasing the risk of retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. Machine learning (artificial intelligence) approaches are being harnessed to incorporate decision support into many medical specialties. Here, we report an algorithm that provides weekly insulin dosage recommendations to adults with T1D using MDI therapy. We employ a unique virtual platform3 to generate over 50,000 glucose observations to train a k-nearest neighbours4 decision support system (KNN-DSS) to identify causes of hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia and determine necessary insulin adjustments from a set of 12 potential recommendations. The KNN-DSS algorithm achieves an overall agreement with board-certified endocrinologists of 67.9% when validated on real-world human data, and delivers safe recommendations, per endocrinologist review. A comparison of inter-physician-recommended adjustments to insulin pump therapy indicates full agreement of 41.2% among endocrinologists, which is consistent with previous measures of inter-physician agreement (41–45%)5. In silico3,6 benchmarking using a platform accepted by the United States Food and Drug Administration for evaluation of artificial pancreas technologies indicates substantial improvement in glycaemic outcomes after 12 weeks of KNN-DSS use. Our data indicate that the KNN-DSS allows for early identification of dangerous insulin regimens and may be used to improve glycaemic outcomes and prevent life-threatening complications in people with T1D. An automated decision support system is reported that provides weekly insulin dosage recommendations to users with T1D and that, when analysing previously collected patient data, exhibits high agreement with recommendations from physicians."}, "authors": [{"id": "83749487", "name": "Nichole S.

The medical field is no exception, and the clinical implementation of AI-equipped medical devices is steadily progressing. In particular, AI is expected to play an important role in realizing the current global trend of precision medicine. In this review, we introduce the history of AI as well as the state of the art of medical AI, focusing on the field of oncology. We also describe the current status of the use of AI for drug discovery in the oncology field. Furthermore, while AI has great potential, there are still many issues that need to be resolved; therefore, we would provide details on current medical AI problems and potential solutions. Abstract In recent years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technology have led to the rapid clinical implementation of devices with AI technology in the medical field. More than 60 AI-equipped medical devices have already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, and the active introduction of AI technology is considered to be an inevitable trend in the future of medicine. In the field of oncology, clinical applications of medical devices using AI technology are already underway, mainly in radiology, and AI technology is expected to be positioned as an important core technology. In particular, “precision medicine,” a medical treatment that selects the most appropriate treatment for each patient based on a vast amount of medical data such as genome information, has become a worldwide trend; AI technology is expected to be utilized in the process of extracting truly useful information from a large amount of medical data and applying it to diagnosis and treatment. In this review, we would like to introduce the history of AI technology and the current state of medical AI, especially in the oncology field, as well as discuss the possibilities and challenges of AI technology in the medical field."}, "authors": [{"id": "5604758", "name": "Ryuji Hamamoto"}, {"id": "35333934", "name": "Kruthi Suvarna"}, {"id": "2150247374", "name": "Masayoshi Yamada"}, {"id": "47891798", "name": "Kazuma Kobayashi"}, {"id": "1478918397", "name": "Norio Shinkai"}, {"id": "2861441", "name": "M.

This study aimed to develop an artificial neural network model that helps to predict the individuals' risk of developing oral cancer based on data on risk factors, systematic medical condition, and clinic-pathological features.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA popular data mining algorithm artificial neural network was used for developing the artificial intelligence-based prediction model. A total of 29 variables that were associated with the patients were used for developing the model. The dataset was randomly split into the training dataset 54 (75%) cases and testing dataset 19 (25%) cases. All records and observations were reviewed by Board-certified oral pathologist.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 73 patients met the eligibility criteria. Twenty-two (30.13%) were benign cases, and 51 (69.86%) were malignant cases. Thirty-seven were female, and 36 were male, with a mean age of 63.09 years. Our analysis displayed that the average sensitivity and specificity of ANN for oral cancer prediction based on the 10-fold cross-validation analysis was 85.71% (95% confidence interval [CI], 57.19-98.22) and 60.00% (95% CI, 14.66-94.73), respectively.

In the past year, an ns-3 extension module called ns3-gym connecting ns-3 with the OpenAI Gym toolkit has been developed, which utilizes Zero MQ sockets as an interprocess communications (IPC) mechanism. In this paper, we propose a newly designed module between ns-3 and multiple Python-based AI frameworks, namely ns3-ai, to provide efficient and high-speed data exchange between the AI engines and ns-3. This module is built based on a shared memory implementation for IPC, which can achieve an IPC transfer speed up to 100 times faster than that of ns3-gym on a benchmark example. We also present our high-level interface design to improve the abstraction between ns-3 and different AI frameworks, and provide an example use case based on a 5G NR scenario. Our evaluation results show that this ns3-ai framework offers performance advantages over ns3-gym, especially for the use cases where large amounts of data must be transferred between ns-3 and the AI framework.

This paper reviews the pertinent aspects of AI in obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) and how these can be applied to improve patient outcomes and reduce the healthcare costs and workload for clinicians. Herein, we will address current AI uses in OB/GYN, and the use of AI as a tool to interpret fetal heart rate (FHR) and cardiotocography (CTG) to aid in the detection of preterm labor, pregnancy complications, and review discrepancies in its interpretation between clinicians to reduce maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. AI systems can be used as tools to create algorithms identifying asymptomatic women with short cervical length who are at risk of preterm birth. Additionally, the benefits of using the vast data capacity of AI storage can assist in determining the risk factors for preterm labor using multiomics and extensive genomic data. In the field of gynecological surgery, the use of augmented reality helps surgeons detect vital structures, thus decreasing complications, reducing operative time, and helping surgeons in training to practice in a realistic setting. Using three-dimensional (3D) printers can provide materials that mimic real tissues and also helps trainees to practice on a realistic model. Furthermore, 3D imaging allows better depth perception than its two-dimensional (2D) counterpart, allowing the surgeon to create preoperative plans according to tissue depth and dimensions. Although AI has some limitations, this new technology can improve the prognosis and management of patients, reduce healthcare costs, and help OB/GYN practitioners to reduce their workload and increase their efficiency and accuracy by incorporating AI systems into their daily practice. AI has the potential to guide practitioners in decision-making, reaching a diagnosis, and improving case management. It can reduce healthcare costs by decreasing medical errors and providing more dependable predictions. AI systems can accurately provide information on the large array of patients in clinical settings, although more robust data is required."}, "authors": [{"id": "15651832", "name": "P.

A global response is needed to prepare health systems worldwide. Covid-19 can be diagnosed both on chest X-ray and on computed tomography (CT). Asymptomatic patients may also have lung lesions on imaging. CT investigation in patients with suspicion Covid-19 pneumonia involves the use of the high-resolution technique (HRCT). Artificial intelligence (AI) software has been employed to facilitate CT diagnosis. AI software must be useful categorizing the disease into different severities, integrating the structured report, prepared according to subjective considerations, with quantitative, objective assessments of the extent of the lesions. In this communication, we present an example of a good tool for the radiologist (Thoracic VCAR software, GE Healthcare, Italy) in Covid-19 diagnosis (Pan et al. in Radiology, 2020. https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2020200370 ). Thoracic VCAR offers quantitative measurements of the lung involvement. Thoracic VCAR can generate a clear, fast and concise report that communicates vital medical information to referring physicians. In the post-processing phase, software, thanks to the help of a colorimetric map, recognizes the ground glass and differentiates it from consolidation and quantifies them as a percentage with respect to the healthy parenchyma. AI software therefore allows to accurately calculate the volume of each of these areas. Therefore, keeping in mind that CT has high diagnostic sensitivity in identifying lesions, but not specific for Covid-19 and similar to other infectious viral diseases, it is mandatory to have an AI software that expresses objective evaluations of the percentage of ventilated lung parenchyma compared to the affected one."}, "authors": [{"id": "3889877", "name": "M.

Within these networks, oceans of data are continuously being generated by sensors, machines, systems, smart devices, and people. Together with rising computational capabilities, this Big Data is being analysed faster, more broadly, and more deeply than ever before. These advances have redefined the value of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies and opened a new age known as Industry 4.0 or the Smart Factory. Advanced cognitive computing and deep learning methods have begun to find application in manufacturing systems for automated visual inspections, fault detection, and maintenance. There are active efforts to apply reinforcement learning methods to material handling systems and production scheduling. Industries hoping to convert real-time data into actionable decisions seek opportunities to integrate AI methods with traditional Operational Research approaches, the concepts and technologies of the Internet of Things (IoT), and cyber-physical systems. The aim of this special issue is to provide insight into the latest advances emerging in the production research community that seek to exploit AI methods in this field. The special issue received 61 submissions from which nine papers were selected. The papers are grouped into three categories: AI methods for manufacturing systems, AI developments specifically in semiconductor manufacturing, and AI in additive manufacturing and maintenance. Within these categories the papers are ordered alphabetically by the last name of the first author. As part of Industry 4.0, the exploitation of data for intelligent decision making is essential for general manufacturing systems. The paper by Deng et al. considers milling systems and endeavours to predict machining parameters that will provide reliable chatter-free milling. They use a neural network to model the limiting axial cutting depth as a component of the second-order fourth-moment method. The next paper by Fang et al. considers the prediction of the time remaining for jobs to be completed in a job shop. Using big data, they develop a deep learning method for the prediction that is superior to previous regression or network-based predictions in their numerical experiments. The third paper in this category by Rao et al. focuses on a bi-objective welding shop scheduling problem. The problem is modelled as a mixed-integer programme and solved via a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with a restarting strategy. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm dominates four other algorithms. There is much excitement regarding the potential for AI in semiconductor manufacturing. In Chien et al., deep reinforcement learning is exploited to guide the selection of demand forecast models for semiconductor components and modules. An empirical study and a real-world implementation demonstrated the validity of the approach. The identification and classification of defects are essential in semiconductor manufacturing and the paper by Kim et al. studies this important problem. They use a generalised uncertain decision tree model to classify defect patterns on multiple wafer maps based on uncertain features and show that their approach is significantly more efficient than existing methods to analyze real DRAM wafers. The problem of dynamic dispatching for unreliable machines in re-entrant production systems, typically semiconductor manufacturing systems, is considered in the paper by Wu et al. They combine a deep neural network model and Markov decision processes (MDP) to rapidly generate near optimal dynamic control policies for problems that are too large to be only solved by MDP, thus showing the potential of machine learning in controlling unreliable manufacturing systems. Additive manufacturing and data-driven maintenance are of increasing importance to support the emergence of truly Smart Factories. In the paper by Elhoone et al., a framework for a cyber additive manufacturing system is developed. Three artificial neural network algorithms are proposed and embedded in a two-stage model to support the dynamic allocation of digital designs to different additive manufacturing techniques. The paper by Stanisavljevic et al. provides insights from an experimental study on methods to detect interferences, and thus improve product quality, in real time in additive manufacturing. Their approach is of practical importance and relies on sensor data and methods such as feature selection and machine learning to reach very high detection rates.

In this article, the adoption of AI in governmental organizations has been researched as a form of information and communication technologies (ICT)–enabled governance innovation in the public sector. Based on findings from three cases of AI adoption in public sector organizations, this article shows strong similarities between the antecedents identified in previous academic literature and the factors contributing to the use of AI in government. The adoption of AI in government does not solely rely on having high-quality data but is facilitated by numerous environmental, organizational, and other factors that are strictly intertwined among each other. To address the specific nature of AI in government and the complexity of its adoption in the public sector, we thus propose a framework to provide a comprehensive overview of the key factors contributing to the successful adoption of AI systems, going beyond the narrow focus on data, processing power, and algorithm development often highlighted in the mainstream AI literature and policy discourse."}, "authors": [{"id": "2139556256", "name": "Colin van Noordt"}, {"id": "34652763", "name": "Gianluca Misuraca"}], "fields_of_study": ["Business"]}

The artificial intelligence approach emerges as the best possible solution to map the relationships between climatic parameters and ET, even with limited knowledge of the interactions between variables. This review presents the state-of-the-art application of artificial intelligence models in ET estimation, along with different types and sources of data. This paper discovers the most significant climatic parameters for different climate patterns. The characteristics of the basic artificial intelligence models are also explored in this review. To overcome the pitfalls of the individual models, hybrid models which use techniques such as data fusion and ensemble modeling, data decomposition as well as remote sensing-based hybridization, are introduced. In particular, the principles and applications of the hybridization techniques, as well as their combinations with basic models, are explained. The review covers most of the related and excellent papers published from 2011 to 2019 to keep its relevancy in terms of time frame and field of study.

Through the establishment of an artificial intelligence educational robot based on voice interaction, a hybrid physical education teaching mode is constructed to realize personalized education for students. First, the speech recognition system is designed from three aspects of speech recognition, interaction management and speech synthesis, and the accuracy of recognition is improved by algorithm. Second, a new mode of hybrid physical education teaching is constructed. Through intelligent information technology, the advantages of traditional physical education teaching are combined to improve the classroom efficiency of physical education teaching and personalized education ability for students. Finally, the relevant experimental scheme and questionnaire are designed, and the actual situation of an educational robot introduced into physical education teaching is investigated and evaluated. The results show that the recognition accuracy of the artificial intelligence speech recognition system can reach more than 90%. It can communicate well with students and answer students’ questions. An educational robot is introduced into physical education teaching, and students’ learning attitude and interest are evaluated. The results show that before and after the introduction of an educational robot in physical education teaching, the average score of students’ learning interest increases by 21 points, and the average score of learning attitude increases by 9.8 points.

Objectives: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as disruptive technologies with the potential to drastically affect clinical decision making in spine surgery. AI can enhance the delivery of spine care in several arenas: (1) preoperative patient workup, patient selection, and outcome prediction; (2) quality and reproducibility of spine research; (3) perioperative surgical assistance and data tracking optimization; and (4) intraoperative surgical performance. The purpose of this narrative review is to concisely assemble, analyze, and discuss current trends and applications of AI and ML in conventional and robotic-assisted spine surgery. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive PubMed search of peer-reviewed articles that were published between 2006 and 2019 examining AI, ML, and robotics in spine surgery. Key findings were then compiled and summarized in this review. Results: The majority of the published AI literature in spine surgery has focused on predictive analytics and supervised image recognition for radiographic diagnosis. Several investigators have studied the use of AI/ML in the perioperative setting in small patient cohorts; pivotal trials are still pending. Conclusions: Artificial intelligence has tremendous potential in revolutionizing comprehensive spine care. Evidence-based, predictive analytics can help surgeons improve preoperative patient selection, surgical indications, and individualized postoperative care. Robotic-assisted surgery, while still in early stages of development, has the potential to reduce surgeon fatigue and improve technical precision."}, "authors": [{"id": "31428638", "name": "Jonathan J Rasouli"}, {"id": "32555434", "name": "Jianning Shao"}, {"id": "35354018", "name": "Sean N.

The existing monitoring devices and protective relays can barely detect high impedance faults (HIFs) and are unable to warn the system operators until serious abnormalities or damages are observed. Aiming at avoiding the damaging consequences of HIFs, an online monitoring system embedded with machine learning analytics is proposed that ensures a fast and accurate detection of HIFs in power systems.

We performed title and abstract and then full-text screening using Covidence. Studies had to involve research, include both AI and primary care, and be published in Eng-lish. We extracted data and summarized studies by 7 attributes: purpose(s); author appointment(s); primary care function(s); intended end user(s); health condition(s); geographic location of data source; and AI subfield(s). RESULTS Of 5,515 unique documents, 405 met eligibility criteria. The body of research focused on developing or modifying AI methods (66.7%) to support physician diagnostic or treatment recommendations (36.5% and 13.8%), for chronic conditions, using data from higher-income countries. Few studies (14.1%) had even a single author with a primary care appointment. The predominant AI subfields were supervised machine learning (40.0%) and expert systems (22.2%).

Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques present a promising way to analyze these multimodal data sets. While AI techniques have been extensively applied to imaging data, there are a limited number of studies employing AI techniques with clinical data from the EHR. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of different AI methods applied to EHR data in the field of ophthalmology. This literature review highlights that the secondary use of EHR data has focused on glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and cataracts with the use of AI techniques.

The principal research methods that determine the logic and practical basis of the application of fuzzy logic in entrepreneurship are highlighted. It has been determined that fuzzy modeling is effective when technological processes are too complex for analysis using generally accepted quantitative methods, or when available sources of information in the business environment are interpreted poorly, inaccurately, and indefinitely. It has been shown experimentally that fuzzy logic gives better results compared to those obtained with generally accepted algorithms for analyzing the quality of doing business. A model of a neuro-fuzzy regulator has been developed and measures for its implementation in the business environment have been proposed. A neural network model in entrepreneurial development has been formed. Studies have shown the possibility of effective use of the principles of artificial intelligence and modeling in solving problems of developing entrepreneurial potential and making business decisions under conditions of uncertainty. This ensures objective and well-grounded decision-making in solving various applied problems of business development and taking into account environmental factors.

Background: Poor implementation and subjective interpretation of CVS contributes to the stable rates of bile duct injuries in LC. As CVS is assessed visually, this task can be automated by using computer vision, an area of artificial intelligence aimed at interpreting images. Methods: Still images from LC videos were annotated with CVS criteria and hepatocystic anatomy segmentation. A deep neural network comprising a segmentation model to highlight hepatocystic anatomy and a classification model to predict CVS criteria achievement was trained and tested using 5-fold cross validation. Intersection over union, average precision, and balanced accuracy were computed to evaluate the model performance versus the annotated ground truth. Results: A total of 2854 images from 201 LC videos were annotated and 402 images were further segmented. Mean intersection over union for segmentation was 66.6%. The model assessed the achievement of CVS criteria with a mean average precision and balanced accuracy of 71.9% and 71.4%, respectively. Conclusions: Deep learning algorithms can be trained to reliably segment hepatocystic anatomy and assess CVS criteria in still laparoscopic images.

China's digital progress benefits from its huge internet market, strong state power and weak civil awareness, making it more competitive than western democratic societies where privacy concern restricts their AI development. However, China's ambitious AI plan contains considerable risks; its overall impact depends on how AI affects major sources of political legitimacy including economic growth, social stability and ideology. China's approach is gambling on its success in (a) delivering a booming AI economy, (b) ensuring a smooth social transformation towards the age of AI and (c) proving ideological superiority of its authoritarian and communist values."}, "authors": [{"id": "1826175", "name": "J.

AI has been applied to resources to improve skills giving teachers the time and freedom to provide understanding and adaptability and drive performance. This paper, written for policymakers in the field of education, highlights the impact of AI and advancements in academic policy. These academic policymakers generate ideas and strategies for applying AI across various disciplines. There is also discussion around AI implementation in education throughout developing nations for moving towards and ensuring affordable, high-quality education for every individual. Education for sustainable development (ESD) aims to promote the development of knowledge, skills, understanding, values and actions necessary to build a sustainable world, to protect and preserve the environment, and promote social equity and economic sustainability. This paper analyses how AI can be used to update learning probabilities by providing examples of how it can be integrated with existing educational systems, using data to improve educational capital and quality in developing countries. It goes on to discuss whether policymakers and institutions can reinvent and rework educational programs to polish graduates’ skills for the growing presence of AI across all disciplines. There are four main parts to this work: (1) different dimensions regarding the complexities and potential implications, (2) the pros and cons of educational sustainability policy related to AI, (3) carving out AI and its outstanding execution, and finally (4) the linkage of AI with higher education within the context of educational expansions.

They enable risk stratifying patients based on individual risk of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy including diabetic macular edema (DME), and predicting which patients with DME best respond to antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nProgress in artificial intelligence and tele-ophthalmology for diabetic retinopathy screening, including artificial intelligence applications in 'real-world settings' and cost-effectiveness studies are summarized. Furthermore, the initial research on the use of artificial intelligence models for diabetic retinopathy risk stratification and management of DME are outlined along with potential future directions. Finally, the need for artificial intelligence adoption within ophthalmology in response to coronavirus disease 2019 is discussed.

Several opinion polls frequently query the public fear of autonomous robots and artificial intelligence, a phenomenon coming also into scholarly focus. As potential threat perceptions arguably vary with regard to the reach and consequences of AI functionalities and the domain of application, research still lacks necessary precision of a respective measurement that allows for wide-spread research applicability. We propose a fine-grained scale to measure threat perceptions of AI that accounts for four functional classes of AI systems and is applicable to various domains of AI applications. Using a standardized questionnaire in a survey study (N = 891), we evaluate the scale over three distinct AI domains (medical treatment, job recruitment, and loan origination). The data support the dimensional structure of the proposed Threats of AI (TAI) scale as well as the internal consistency and factoral validity of the indicators.

Wound care teams capture images of wounds during clinical visits generating big datasets over time. Developing novel artificial intelligence (AI) systems can help clinicians diagnose, assess the effectiveness of therapy, and predict healing outcomes. Recent Advances: Rapid developments in computer processing have enabled the development of AI-based systems that can improve the diagnosis and effectiveness of therapy in various clinical specializations. In the past decade, we have witnessed AI revolutionizing all types of medical imaging like X-ray, ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, etc., but AI-based systems remain to be developed clinically and computationally for high-quality wound care that can result in better patient outcomes. Critical Issues: In the current standard of care, collecting wound images on every clinical visit, interpreting and archiving the data are cumbersome and time consuming. Commercial platforms are developed to capture images, perform wound measurements, and provide clinicians with a workflow for diagnosis, but AI-based systems are still in their infancy. This systematic review summarizes the breadth and depth of the most recent and relevant work in intelligent image-based data analysis and system developments for wound assessment.

Although some chatbots have shown promising early efficacy results, there is limited information about how people use these chatbots. Understanding the usage patterns of chatbots for depression represents a crucial step toward improving chatbot design and providing information about the strengths and limitations of the chatbots. Objective This study aims to understand how users engage and are redirected through a chatbot for depression (Tess) to provide design recommendations. Methods Interactions of 354 users with the Tess depression modules were analyzed to understand chatbot usage across and within modules. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze participant flow through each depression module, including characters per message, completion rate, and time spent per module. Slide plots were also used to analyze the flow across and within modules. Results Users sent a total of 6220 messages, with a total of 86,298 characters, and, on average, they engaged with Tess depression modules for 46 days. There was large heterogeneity in user engagement across different modules, which appeared to be affected by the length, complexity, content, and style of questions within the modules and the routing between modules. Conclusions Overall, participants engaged with Tess; however, there was a heterogeneous usage pattern because of varying module designs.

With the technical development of new methods and the expansion to new fields of application, this trend is likely to become even more pronounced in future. Possible means of application range from automated image reading and classification to correlation with clinical outcomes and to technological applications in image processing and reconstruction. In the context of tumor imaging, that is, predominantly FDG or PSMA PET imaging but also bone scintigraphy, artificial intelligence approaches can be used to quantify the whole-body tumor volume, for the segmentation and classification of pathological foci or to facilitate the diagnosis of micro-metastases. More advanced applications aim at the correlation of image features that are derived by artificial intelligence with clinical endpoints, for example, whole-body tumor volume with overall survival. In nuclear medicine imaging of benign diseases, artificial intelligence methods are predominantly used for automated and/or facilitated image classification and clinical decision making. Automated feature selection, segmentation and classification of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy can help in identifying patients that would benefit from intervention and to forecast clinical prognosis. Automated reporting of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease might be extended to early diagnosis-being of special interest, if targeted treatment options might become available. Technological approaches include artificial intelligence-based attenuation correction of PET images, image reconstruction or anatomical landmarking. Attenuation correction is of special interest for avoiding the need of a coregistered CT scan, in the process of image reconstruction artefacts might be reduced, or ultra low-dose PET images might be denoised. The development of accurate ultra low-dose PET imaging might broaden the method's applicability, for example, toward oncologic PET screening. Most artificial intelligence approaches in nuclear medicine imaging are still in early stages of development, further improvements are necessary for broad clinical applications. In this review, we describe the current trends in the context fields of body oncology, cardiac imaging, and neuroimaging while an additional section puts emphasis on technological trends. Our aim is not only to describe currently available methods, but also to place a special focus on the description of possible future developments."}, "authors": [{"id": "144368614", "name": "R.

We ask: How is the use of AI both changing and changed by the bureaucratic form of public organizations, and what effect does this have on the use of discretion? The diffusion of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has changed administrative behavior in public organizations. Recent advances in AI have led to its increasing use, but too little is known about the relationship between this distinct form of ICT and to both the exercise of discretion and bureaucratic form along the continuum from street- to system-levels. We articulate a theoretical framework that integrates work on the unique effects of AI on discretion and its relationship to task and organizational context with the theory of system-level bureaucracy. We use this framework to examine two strongly differing cases of public sector AI use: health insurance auditing, and policing. We find AI’s effect on discretion is nonlinear and nonmonotonic as a function of bureaucratic form. At the same time, the use of AI may act as an accelerant in transitioning organizations from street- and screen-level to system-level bureaucracies, even if these organizations previously resisted such changes."}, "authors": [{"id": "134140023", "name": "Justin B.

Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of AI that most dental AI research is dedicated to. The most prolific area of ML research is automated interpretation of dental imaging. Other areas include providing treatment recommendations, predicting future disease and treatment outcomes. The research impact is limited by small datasets that do not harness the positive correlation between very large datasets and ML performance. There is also a need to standardise research methodologies and utilise performance metrics that are appropriate for the clinical context. In addition to research challenges, this article discusses the ethical, legal and logistical considerations associated with implementation in clinical practice. This includes explainable AI, model bias, data privacy and security. The future implications of AI in dentistry involve a promise for a novel form of practicing dentistry however, the effect of AI on patient outcomes is yet to be determined."}, "authors": [{"id": "2039141562", "name": "Farhana Pethani"}], "fields_of_study": ["Medicine"]}

We explore its potential IPC benefits in epidemiology, laboratory infection diagnosis, and hand hygiene. Recent Findings AI has the potential to detect transmission events during outbreaks or predict high-risk patients, enabling development of tailored IPC interventions. AI offers opportunities to enhance diagnostics with objective pattern recognition, standardize the diagnosis of infections with IPC implications, and facilitate the dissemination of IPC expertise. AI hand hygiene applications can deliver behavior change, though it requires further evaluation in different clinical settings. However, staff can become dependent on automatic reminders, and performance returns to baseline if feedback is removed. Summary Advantages for IPC include speed, consistency, and capability of handling infinitely large datasets. However, many challenges remain; improving the availability of high-quality representative datasets and consideration of biases within preexisting databases are important challenges for future developments. AI in itself will not improve IPC; this requires culture and behavior change. Most studies to date assess performance retrospectively so there is a need for prospective evaluation in the real-life, often chaotic, clinical setting.

Recent developments in artificial neural networks, machine learning, and deep learning have ignited debate with respect to ethical and legal challenges associated with the use of AI in healthcare and medicine. While AI in nuclear medicine has the potential to improve workflow and productivity, and enhance clinical and research capabilities, there remains a professional responsibility to the profession and to patients: ethical, social, and legal. Enthusiasm to embrace new technology should not displace responsibilities for the ethical, social, and legal application of technology. This is especially true in relation to data usage, the algorithms applied, and how algorithms are used in practice. Governance of software and algorithms used for detection (segmentation) and/or diagnosis (classification) of disease using medical images requires rigorous evidence-based regulation. A number of frameworks have been developed for ethical application of AI generally in society and in radiology. For nuclear medicine, consideration needs to be given to beneficence, nonmaleficence, fairness and justice, safety, reliability, data security, privacy and confidentiality, mitigation of bias, transparency, explainability, and autonomy. AI is merely a tool, how it is utilised is a human choice.

The majority of studies identified corresponded to the area of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in particular to COPD and chest computed tomography scans, interpretation of pulmonary function tests, exacerbations and treatment. Another field of interest is the application of AI and ML to the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease, and a few other studies were identified on the fields of mechanical ventilation, interpretation of images on chest X-ray and diagnosis of bronchial asthma. Expert opinion ML may help to make clinical decisions but will not replace the physician completely. Human errors in medicine are associated with large financial losses, and many of them could be prevented with the help of AI and ML.

However, health care has been relatively late to adopt them. This article provides clinical examples in which machine learning and artificial intelligence are already in use in health care and appear to deliver benefit. Three key bottlenecks toward increasing the pace of diffusion and adoption are methodological issues in evaluation of artificial intelligence-based interventions, reporting standards to enable assessment of model performance, and issues that need to be addressed for an institution to adopt these interventions. Methodological best practices will include external validation, ideally at a different site; use of proactive learning algorithms to correct for site-specific biases and increase robustness as algorithms are deployed across multiple sites; addressing subgroup performance; and communicating to providers the uncertainty of predictions. Regarding reporting, especially important issues are the extent to which implementing standardized approaches for introducing clinical decision support has been followed, describing the data sources, reporting on data assumptions, and addressing biases. Although most health care organizations in the United States have adopted electronic health records, they may be ill prepared to adopt machine learning and artificial intelligence. Several steps can enable this: preparing data, developing tools to get suggestions to clinicians in useful ways, and getting clinicians engaged in the process. Open challenges and the role of regulation in this area are briefly discussed. Although these techniques have enormous potential to improve care and personalize recommendations for individuals, the hype regarding them is tremendous.

In biomedicine, AI has already shown tremendous potential, e.g., in the interpretation of next-generation sequencing data and in the design of clinical decision support systems. Objectives  However, training an AI model on sensitive data raises concerns about the privacy of individual participants. For example, summary statistics of a genome-wide association study can be used to determine the presence or absence of an individual in a given dataset. This considerable privacy risk has led to restrictions in accessing genomic and other biomedical data, which is detrimental for collaborative research and impedes scientific progress. Hence, there has been a substantial effort to develop AI methods that can learn from sensitive data while protecting individuals' privacy. Method  This paper provides a structured overview of recent advances in privacy-preserving AI techniques in biomedicine. It places the most important state-of-the-art approaches within a unified taxonomy and discusses their strengths, limitations, and open problems. Conclusion  As the most promising direction, we suggest combining federated machine learning as a more scalable approach with other additional privacy-preserving techniques. This would allow to merge the advantages to provide privacy guarantees in a distributed way for biomedical applications. Nonetheless, more research is necessary as hybrid approaches pose new challenges such as additional network or computation overhead."}, "authors": [{"id": "1394265687", "name": "Reihaneh Torkzadehmahani"}, {"id": "9237613", "name": "Reza Nasirigerdeh"}, {"id": "40425345", "name": "David B.

Assessing a company’s financial security using only economic indicators—as suggested in the existing literature—would be inaccurate when undertaking a comprehensive study of financial security. Specifically, indices and indicators based on financial or managerial reporting calculated at any particular point in time, provide only a superficial understanding—and may even distort the overall picture. It has also been suggested that expert assessment is the most objective method, although it has disadvantages related to individual cognitive limitations. These limitations are not particular to artificial intelligence, which could assess an enterprise’s financial security in a less biased way. However, by only imitating human behavior, it is not able to perceive and evaluate with intuition the dynamics of the company’s development and holistically assess the financial condition—despite the possibility of learning and forecasting—because artificial intelligence is not able to think and predict, which, in an enterprise, is the most important skill of a manager. Therefore, the risk of developing artificial intelligence to assess a firm’s financial security lies in a biased assessment of the enterprise’s activities in general—and its financial security in particular."}, "authors": [{"id": "2351937746", "name": "Oleksandr Melnychenko"}], "fields_of_study": ["Business"]}

However, applications at the point of care are still scarce. Objective Review and discuss case studies to understand current capabilities for applying AI/ML in the healthcare setting, and regulatory requirements in the US, Europe and China. Methods A targeted narrative literature review of AI/ML based digital tools was performed. Scientific publications (identified in PubMed) and grey literature (identified on the websites of regulatory agencies) were reviewed and analyzed. Results From the regulatory perspective, AI/ML-based solutions can be considered medical devices (i.e., Software as Medical Device, SaMD). A case series of SaMD is presented. First, tools for monitoring and remote management of chronic diseases are presented. Second, imaging applications for diagnostic support are discussed. Finally, clinical decision support tools to facilitate the choice of treatment and precision dosing are reviewed. While tested and validated algorithms for precision dosing exist, their implementation at the point of care is limited, and their regulatory and commercialization pathway is not clear. Regulatory requirements depend on the level of risk associated with the use of the device in medical practice, and can be classified into administrative (manufacturing and quality control), software-related (design, specification, hazard analysis, architecture, traceability, software risk analysis, cybersecurity, etc.), clinical evidence (including patient perspectives in some cases), non-clinical evidence (dosing validation and biocompatibility/toxicology) and other, such as e.g. benefit-to-risk determination, risk assessment and mitigation. There generally is an alignment between the US and Europe. China additionally requires that the clinical evidence is applicable to the Chinese population and recommends that a third-party central laboratory evaluates the clinical trial results. Conclusions The number of promising AI/ML-based technologies is increasing, but few have been implemented widely at the point of care. The need for external validation, implementation logistics, and data exchange and privacy remain the main obstacles."}, "authors": [{"id": "2327721528", "name": "Michiel Warlé"}, {"id": "46678951", "name": "H.

Understanding what AI is good for, how to evaluate it, what are its limitations, and how it can be implemented are not well understood. With a survey, we aimed to evaluate the thoughts of stakeholders in laboratory medicine on the value of AI in the diagnostics space and identify anticipated challenges and solutions to introducing AI. Methods We conducted a web-based survey on the use of AI with participants from Roche’s Strategic Advisory Network that included key stakeholders in laboratory medicine. Results In total, 128 of 302 stakeholders responded to the survey. Most of the participants were medical practitioners (26%) or laboratory managers (22%). AI is currently used in the organizations of 15.6%, while 66.4% felt they might use it in the future. Most had an unsure attitude on what they would need to adopt AI in the diagnostics space. High investment costs, lack of proven clinical benefits, number of decision makers, and privacy concerns were identified as barriers to adoption. Education in the value of AI, streamlined implementation and integration into existing workflows, and research to prove clinical utility were identified as solutions needed to mainstream AI in laboratory medicine. Conclusions This survey demonstrates that specific knowledge of AI in the medical community is poor and that AI education is much needed.

Based on these theoretical insights, the paper presents a qualitative evaluation of the augmentation potential of AI to assist individual and organizational learning in the workplace.FindingsThe core outcome is that there is an augmentation potential of AI to enhance individual learning and development in the workplace, which however should not be overestimated. AI has a complementarity to individual intelligence, which can lead to an advancement, especially in quality, accuracy and precision. Moreover, AI has a potential to support individual competence development and organizational learning processes. However, a further outcome is that AI in the workplace is a double-edged sword, as it easily shows reinforcement effects in individual and organizational learning, which have a backside of unintended effects.Research limitations/implicationsThe conceptual outline makes use of examples for illustrating phenomenon but needs further empirical analysis. The research focus on the meso level of the workplace does not fully refer to macro level outcomes.Practical implicationsThe practical implication is that it is a matter of socio-technical job design to integrate AI in the workplace in a valuable manner. There is a need to keep the human-in-the-loop and to complement AI-based learning approaches with non-AI counterparts to reach augmentation.Originality/valueThe paper faces workplace learning from an interdisciplinary perspective and bridges insights from learning theory with methods from the machine learning community. It directs the social science discourse on AI, which is often on macro level to the meso level of the workplace and related issues for job design and therefore provides a complementary perspective."}, "authors": [{"id": "65775351", "name": "Uta Wilkens"}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science"]}

We propose a dietary assessment system based on artificial intelligence (AI), named goFOODTM. The system can estimate the calorie and macronutrient content of a meal, on the sole basis of food images captured by a smartphone. goFOODTM requires an input of two meal images or a short video. For conventional single-camera smartphones, the images must be captured from two different viewing angles; smartphones equipped with two rear cameras require only a single press of the shutter button. The deep neural networks are used to process the two images and implements food detection, segmentation and recognition, while a 3D reconstruction algorithm estimates the food’s volume. Each meal’s calorie and macronutrient content is calculated from the food category, volume and the nutrient database. goFOODTM supports 319 fine-grained food categories, and has been validated on two multimedia databases that contain non-standardized and fast food meals. The experimental results demonstrate that goFOODTM performed better than experienced dietitians on the non-standardized meal database, and was comparable to them on the fast food database. goFOODTM provides a simple and efficient solution to the end-user for dietary assessment."}, "authors": [{"id": "2139534945", "name": "Ya Lu"}, {"id": "120212146", "name": "Thomai Stathopoulou"}, {"id": "50822395", "name": "Maria F.

Therefore, ST data at each spot needs to be disentangled so as to reveal the cell compositions at that spatial spot. In this study, we propose a novel method, named DSTG, to accurately deconvolute the observed gene expressions at each spot and recover its cell constitutions, thus achieve high-level segmentation and reveal spatial architecture of cellular heterogeneity within tissues. DSTG not only demonstrates superior performance on synthetic spatial data generated from different protocols, but also effectively identifies spatial compositions of cells in mouse cortex layer, hippocampus slice, and pancreatic tumor tissues. In conclusion, DSTG accurately uncovers the cell states and subpopulations based on spatial localization."}, "authors": [{"id": "2087680154", "name": "Jing Su"}, {"id": "48181918", "name": "Qianqian Song"}], "fields_of_study": ["Biology", "Computer Science", "Medicine"]}

As of April 23, 2020, 2.7 million cases have been confirmed, over 190,000 people are dead, and about 750,000 people are reported recovered. Yet, there is no publicly available data on tests that could be missing infections. Complicating matters and furthering anxiety are specific instances of false-negative tests. Methods We developed a deep learning model to improve accuracy of reported cases and to precisely predict the disease from chest X-ray scans. Our model relied on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect structural abnormalities and disease categorization that were keys to uncovering hidden patterns. To do so, a transfer learning approach was deployed to perform detections from the chest anterior-posterior radiographs of patients. We used publicly available datasets to achieve this. Results Our results offer very high accuracy (96.3%) and loss (0.151 binary cross-entropy) using the public dataset consisting of patients from different countries worldwide. As the confusion matrix indicates, our model is able to accurately identify true negatives (74) and true positives (32); this deep learning model identified three cases of false-positive and one false-negative finding from the healthy patient scans. Conclusions Our COVID-19 detection model minimizes manual interaction dependent on radiologists as it automates identification of structural abnormalities in patient’s CXRs, and our deep learning model is likely to detect true positives and true negatives and weed out false positive and false negatives with > 96.3% accuracy."}, "authors": [{"id": "1582900745", "name": "Shashank Vaid"}, {"id": "2249422629", "name": "Reza Kalantar"}, {"id": "2511932", "name": "M.

The authors describe the results of research received in the process of developing models that serve as an integrated framework for an artificial intelligence enabled traffic monitoring system. The proposed system deploys several state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to automate different traffic monitoring needs. Taking advantage of a large database of annotated video surveillance data, deep learning-based models are trained to detect queues, track stationary vehicles, and tabulate vehicle counts. A pixel-level segmentation approach is applied to detect traffic queues and predict severity. Real-time object detection algorithms coupled with different tracking systems are deployed to automatically detect stranded vehicles as well as perform vehicular counts.

Thus, one question naturally arises: What happens when multimedia meets Artificial Intelligence? To answer this question, we introduce the concept of Multimedia Intelligence through investigating the mutual-influence between multimedia and Artificial Intelligence. We explore the mutual influences between multimedia and Artificial Intelligence from two aspects: i) multimedia drives Artificial Intelligence to experience a paradigm shift towards more explainability and ii) Artificial Intelligence in turn injects new ways of thinking for multimedia research.

In this work, we aim to examine AI roles in early design stages. The human ideation components and design tools related to AI are discussed in a framework of AI-augmented design support. The framework develops a hierarchy of design cognition (basis), approaches and principles. The cognitive models are constructed in an empirical study of 30 designers (26 for analysis, 4 for pilot study) by concurrent Think-Aloud protocol and behavior analysis. The process of producing new design ideas is explained by a transparent analysis of designers’ language and behaviors. Three strategies to organize cognitive activities in design ideation are summarized: develop structured consideration, relate to a scenario, and stick-to designing. These strategies suggest AI could act as (1) representation creation, (2) empathy trigger and (3) engagement, in principles of “knowledge-driven” and “decompose-and-integrate”. The design support with AI provides new perspectives on computer-based design tools that limit to well-defined design variables.

It is of critical importance to detect aneurysms, identify risk factors of rupture, and predict treatment response of aneurysms to guide clinical interventions. Artificial intelligence has received worldwide attention for its impressive performance in image-based tasks. Artificial intelligence serves as an adjunct to physicians in a series of clinical settings, which substantially improves diagnostic accuracy while reducing physicians’ workload. Computer-assisted diagnosis systems of aneurysms based on MRA and CTA using deep learning have been evaluated, and excellent performances have been reported. Artificial intelligence has also been used in automated morphologic calculation, rupture risk stratification, and outcomes prediction with the implementation of machine learning methods, which have exhibited incremental value. This review summarizes current advances of artificial intelligence in the management of aneurysms, including detection and prediction.

Traditional skin cancer diagnosis methods are costly, require a professional physician, and take time. Hence, to aid in diagnosing skin cancer, artificial intelligence (AI) tools are being used, including shallow and deep machine learning–based methodologies that are trained to detect and classify skin cancer using computer algorithms and deep neural networks. Objective The aim of this study was to identify and group the different types of AI-based technologies used to detect and classify skin cancer. The study also examined the reliability of the selected papers by studying the correlation between the data set size and the number of diagnostic classes with the performance metrics used to evaluate the models. Methods We conducted a systematic search for papers using Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore, Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library (ACM DL), and Ovid MEDLINE databases following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. The studies included in this scoping review had to fulfill several selection criteria: being specifically about skin cancer, detecting or classifying skin cancer, and using AI technologies. Study selection and data extraction were independently conducted by two reviewers. Extracted data were narratively synthesized, where studies were grouped based on the diagnostic AI techniques and their evaluation metrics. Results We retrieved 906 papers from the 3 databases, of which 53 were eligible for this review. Shallow AI-based techniques were used in 14 studies, and deep AI-based techniques were used in 39 studies. The studies used up to 11 evaluation metrics to assess the proposed models, where 39 studies used accuracy as the primary evaluation metric. Overall, studies that used smaller data sets reported higher accuracy. Conclusions This paper examined multiple AI-based skin cancer detection models. However, a direct comparison between methods was hindered by the varied use of different evaluation metrics and image types. Performance scores were affected by factors such as data set size, number of diagnostic classes, and techniques. Hence, the reliability of shallow and deep models with higher accuracy scores was questionable since they were trained and tested on relatively small data sets of a few diagnostic classes."}, "authors": [{"id": "1870130151", "name": "Abdulrahman Takiddin"}, {"id": "153036347", "name": "Jens Schneider"}, {"id": "2146419020", "name": "Yin Yang"}, {"id": "1411490511", "name": "Alaa A.

The aims of this study were to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model and compare its TMJOA diagnostic performance from OPGs with that of an oromaxillofacial radiology (OMFR) expert. An AI model was developed using Karas’ ResNet model and trained to classify images into three categories: normal, indeterminate OA, and OA. This study included 1189 OPG images confirmed by cone-beam CT and evaluated the results by model (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score) and diagnostic performance (accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity). The model performance was unsatisfying when AI was developed with 3 categories. After the indeterminate OA images were reclassified as normal, OA, or omission, the AI diagnosed TMJOA in a similar manner to an expert and was in most accord with CBCT when the indeterminate OA category was omitted (accuracy: 0.78, sensitivity: 0.73, and specificity: 0.82). Our deep learning model showed a sensitivity equivalent to that of an expert, with a better balance between sensitivity and specificity, which implies that AI can play an important role in primary diagnosis of TMJOA from OPGs in most general practice clinics where OMFR experts or CT are not available."}, "authors": [{"id": "2092043109", "name": "Eunhye Choi"}, {"id": "2145184494", "name": "Donghyun Kim"}, {"id": "4473082", "name": "Jeong-Yun Lee"}, {"id": "153540956", "name": "HeeJung Park"}], "fields_of_study": ["Medicine"]}

Yield monitoring is an example where these properties affect the quantified estimation of yield mass. In this study, we propose an image-processing and artificial intelligence-based system using multi-class detection with instance-wise segmentation of fruits in an image that can further estimate dimensions and mass. We analyze a tomato image dataset with mass and dimension values collected using a calibrated vision system and accurate measuring devices. After successful detection and instance-wise segmentation, we extract the real-world dimensions of the fruit. Our characterization results exhibited a significantly high correlation between dimensions and mass, indicating that artificial intelligence algorithms can effectively capture this complex physical relation to estimate the final mass. We also compare different artificial intelligence algorithms to show that the computed mass agrees well with the actual mass. Detection and segmentation results show an average mask intersection over union of 96.05%, mean average precision of 92.28%, detection accuracy of 99.02%, and precision of 99.7%. The mean absolute percentage error for mass estimation was 7.09 for 77 test samples using a bagged ensemble tree regressor.

One strategy to reduce readmissions is to direct resources to patients at the highest risk of readmission. This strategy necessitates a robust predictive model coupled with effective, patient-centered interventions. Objective The aim of this study was to reduce unplanned hospital readmissions through the use of artificial intelligence-based clinical decision support. Methods A commercially vended artificial intelligence tool was implemented at a regional hospital in La Crosse, Wisconsin between November 2018 and April 2019. The tool assessed all patients admitted to general care units for risk of readmission and generated recommendations for interventions intended to decrease readmission risk. Similar hospitals were used as controls. Change in readmission rate was assessed by comparing the 6-month intervention period to the same months of the previous calendar year in exposure and control hospitals. Results Among 2,460 hospitalizations assessed using the tool, 611 were designated by the tool as high risk. Sensitivity and specificity for risk assignment were 65% and 89%, respectively. Over 6 months following implementation, readmission rates decreased from 11.4% during the comparison period to 8.1% (p < 0.001). After accounting for the 0.5% decrease in readmission rates (from 9.3 to 8.8%) at control hospitals, the relative reduction in readmission rate was 25% (p < 0.001). Among patients designated as high risk, the number needed to treat to avoid one readmission was 11. Conclusion We observed a decrease in hospital readmission after implementing artificial intelligence-based clinical decision support. Our experience suggests that use of artificial intelligence to identify patients at the highest risk for readmission can reduce quality gaps when coupled with patient-centered interventions."}, "authors": [{"id": "2271985759", "name": "Santiago Romero-Brufau"}, {"id": "2272180060", "name": "Kirk D.

The proposed system emerges from a conceptual framework where advertising creativity is more broadly defined as a search process, the outcomes of which should be evaluated based on a set of rules. This broader definition provides a generative perspective and extends current approaches to advertising creativity that are mainly based on outcome measures such as perceived novelty and appropriateness (value). The framework is flexible enough to accommodate existing advertising concepts such as advertising templates and explain why executional advertising elements are not consistently effective across different ads. The proposed system can be used both as a reflection and a generation tool for advertising creators and offers promising opportunities for interdisciplinary research.

However, under the general law of higher education, the teaching and education of a certain category or subject has its special regularity. Besides, students in colleges and universities have different demands of education. To address the challenges in higher education, it is very important to carry out higher education reform in colleges and universities. Personalized education has been considered to be a new educational model that is a result of the individual desire of students and the development of society. Traditional methodologies of teaching in colleges and universities cannot fulfill the implementation of personalized training. Hence, it is very urgent to develop new methodologies for personalized training. Among the methodologies of realization of personalized training, artificial intelligence is one of the most important methodologies. We exploit artificial intelligence for personalize education reform. First, we analyze the information of students before entering the colleges and universities. Then, we propose a method to extract modeling features of the student information. Second, we propose a method to build a personalized training model based on artificial intelligence. Third, we propose a method to predict the development track of students based on the personalized training model. On the basis of above designs, we design personalized training for students in colleges and universities. Furthermore, we implement our design by using artificial intelligence.

Furthermore, the organization will need to be transformed to be able to integrate AI-based systems into their human work-force. In addition, the more technical aspects of the underlying machine learning model have to be discussed in terms of how they impact the various units of a business: Where do the relevant data come from, which constraints have to be considered, how is the quality of the data and the prediction evaluated? The Enterprise AI canvas is designed to bring data scientist and business expert together to discuss and define all relevant aspects which need to be clarified in order to integrate AI-based systems into a digital enterprise.

Using a national survey in Spain (n = 5200) and linear regression models, we show that common explanations regarding opposition to artificial intelligence, such as competition and relative vulnerability theories, are not confirmed or have limited explanatory power. Stronger effects are shown by social values and general attitudes to science. Those expressing egalitarian values and privacy concerns, as well as those less predisposed to innovation in a general sense, are more prone to oppose both technological applications. Lastly, we found evidence that, as in other complex technological applications, a new cognitive shortcut is produced.

This will require advancements that go beyond the basic components of general intelligence. The term “intelligence” does not best represent the technological needs of advancing society, because it is “wisdom”, rather than intelligence, that is associated with greater well-being, happiness, health, and perhaps even longevity of the individual and the society. Thus, the future need in technology is for artificial wisdom (AW). Methods: We examine the constructs of human intelligence and human wisdom in terms of their basic components, neurobiology, and relationship to aging, based on published empirical literature. We review the development of AI as inspired and driven by the model of human intelligence, and consider possible governing principles for AW that would enable humans to develop computers which can operationally utilize wise principles and result in wise acts. We review relevant examples of current efforts to develop such wise technologies. Results: AW systems will be based on developmental models of the neurobiology of human wisdom. These AW systems need to be able to a) learn from experience and self-correct; b) exhibit compassionate, unbiased, and ethical behaviors; and c) discern human emotions and help the human users to regulate their emotions and make wise decisions. Conclusions: A close collaboration among computer scientists, neuroscientists, mental health experts, and ethicists is necessary for developing AW technologies, which will emulate the qualities of wise humans and thus serve the greatest benefit to humanity. Just as human intelligence and AI have helped further the understanding and usefulness of each other, human wisdom and AW can aid in promoting each other’s growth"}, "authors": [{"id": "74263382", "name": "D.

The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of an artificial intelligence-based early warning system with that of conventional methods in a real hospital situation.\n\n\nDESIGN\nRetrospective cohort study.\n\n\nSETTING\nThis study was conducted at a hospital in which deep learning-based early warning system was implemented.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nWe reviewed the records of adult patients who were admitted to the general ward of our hospital from April 2018 to March 2019.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nThe study population included 8,039 adult patients. A total 83 events of deterioration occurred during the study period. The outcome was events of deterioration, defined as cardiac arrest and unexpected ICU admission. We defined a true alarm as an alarm occurring within 0.5-24 hours before a deteriorating event.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\nWe used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, area under the precision-recall curve, number needed to examine, and mean alarm count per day as comparative measures. The deep learning-based early warning system (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.865; area under the precision-recall curve, 0.066) outperformed the modified early warning score (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.682; area under the precision-recall curve, 0.010) and reduced the number needed to examine and mean alarm count per day by 69.2% and 59.6%, respectively. At the same specificity, deep learning-based early warning system had up to 257% higher sensitivity than conventional methods.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe developed artificial intelligence based on deep-learning, deep learning-based early warning system, accurately predicted deterioration of patients in a general ward and outperformed conventional methods. This study showed the potential and effectiveness of artificial intelligence in an rapid response system, which can be applied together with electronic health records. This will be a useful method to identify patients with deterioration and help with precise decision-making in daily practice."}, "authors": [{"id": "88182620", "name": "Kyung-Jae Cho"}, {"id": "1491870315", "name": "Oyeon Kwon"}, {"id": "82202598", "name": "J.

The goal of financial inclusion is threatened by the imperfect and ungoverned design and implementation of AI decision-making software making important financial decisions affecting customers. Automated decision-making algorithms have displayed evidence of bias, lack ethical governance, and limit transparency in the basis for their decisions, causing unfair outcomes and amplify unequal access to finance. Poverty reduction and sustainable development targets are risked by Big Tech's potential exploitation of developing countries by using AI to harvest data and profits. Stakeholder progress toward preventing financial crime and corruption is further threatened by potential misuse of AI. In the light of such risks, Big Tech's unscrupulous history means it cannot be trusted to operate without regulatory oversight. The article proposes effective pre-emptive regulatory options to minimize scenarios of AI damaging the SDGs. It explores internationally accepted principles of AI governance, and argues for their implementation as regulatory requirements governing AI developers and coders, with compliance verified through algorithmic auditing. Furthermore, it argues that AI governance frameworks must require a benefit to the SDGs. The article argues that proactively predicting such problems can enable continued AI innovation through well-designed regulations adhering to international principles. It highlights risks of unregulated AI causing harm to human interests, where a public and regulatory backlash may result in over-regulation that could damage the otherwise beneficial development of AI."}, "authors": [{"id": "82091862", "name": "J.

Studies are being conducted that prove that artificial intelligence algorithms can be used in the field of ophthalmology, especially in diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and retinopathy of prematurity. Some of these algorithms have come to the approval stage. The current point in artificial intelligence studies shows that this technology has advanced considerably and shows promise for future work. It is believed that artificial intelligence applications will be effective in identifying patients with preventable vision loss and directing them to physicians, especially in developing countries where there are fewer trained professionals and physicians are difficult to reach. When we consider the possibility that some future artificial intelligence systems may be candidates for moral/ethical status, certain ethical issues arise. Questions about moral/ethical status are important in some areas of applied ethics. Although it is accepted that current intelligence systems do not have moral/ethical status, it has yet to be determined what the exact the characteristics that confer moral/ethical status are or will be."}, "authors": [{"id": "3692296", "name": "K.

Being fundamentally tools, AI systems are fully under the control and responsibility of their owners or users. However, their potential autonomy and capability to learn require that design considers accountability, responsibility, and transparency principles in an explicit and systematic manner. The main concern of Responsible AI is thus the identification of the relative responsibility of all actors involved in the design, development, deployment, and use of AI systems. Firstly, society must be prepared to take responsibility for AI impact. Secondly, Responsible AI implies the need for mechanisms that enable AI systems to act according to ethics and human values. Lastly, Responsible AI is about participation.

Studies in the field of complex systems have generated new perspectives on the application of management strategies in health systems. Much of this research appears as a natural extension of the cross-disciplinary field of systems theory. Since writing my 1st article for Managing Organizational Complexity in 2004, much has happened to further our understanding of complexity in healthcare systems. The growth of new computational methods in the fields of data science and data analytics has allowed scientists to identify signals or patterns in large complex data sets (big data) that in the past were seemingly hidden. Rather than relying on historical statistical methods to infer outcomes, these advanced methods combined with increased computer processing power allow machines to learn the structure of data and create artificial intelligence (AI). In our ongoing efforts to find solutions for complex healthcare problems, AI is becoming more and more an accepted method. The purpose of this edition of Managing Organizational Complexity is to define AI and machine learning, discuss the recent resurgence of AI, and then provide examples of how AI can provide value to healthcare with an emphasis on nursing."}, "authors": [{"id": "2160179", "name": "T.

Drones have proven their potential in providing real‐time cost‐efficient solutions for several applications like healthcare, smart grid surveillance, smart city monitoring, and border surveillance.

Most of these solutions were based on cryptographic techniques and are highly compute extensive. There exist few blockchain‐based solutions, which suffer from high transaction storage costs with communication reliability, latency, and bandwidth issues. Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey to secure drone communication and propose a blockchain‐based secure and intelligent drone communication architecture underlying 5G communication network and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The proposed architecture uses an InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) as a platform for data storage, which ensures improved network performance, communication security and privacy, and reduces transaction storage cost. Further, it facilitates efficient drone communication in providing dynamic, flexible, and on‐the‐fly decisions competencies through 5G and AI technologies.

We focus specifically on military power, as new methods and modes thereof will alter the constitution of security relationships around the world and affect the ability of states to bargain, signal, and influence in the twenty-first century. We argue that, though rapid adoption of AI technologies stands to transform states’ ways of war on a number of fronts, an AI revolution brings with it new forms of risk that must be reconciled with the widespread integration of algorithmic systems across military functions. Where new technology promises a transformation of the character of military power in some veins, it also complicates the cognitive aspects of decision-making and bureaucratic interactions in security institutions. The speed with which complex integrated AI systems enable entirely new modes of war also stands to detach human agency in a potentially destabilizing fashion from the conduct of warfare on several fronts.

Methods The study included 26,499 pairs of SAP and SDOCT from 15,173 eyes of 8878 patients with glaucoma or suspected of having the disease extracted from the Duke Glaucoma Registry. The data set was randomly divided at the patient level in training and test sets. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was initially trained and validated to predict the 52 sensitivity threshold points of the 24-2 SAP from the 768 RNFL thickness points of the SDOCT peripapillary scan. Simulated localized RNFL defects of varied locations and depths were created by modifying the normal average peripapillary RNFL profile. The simulated profiles were then fed to the previously trained CNN, and the topographic SF relationships between structural defects and SAP functional losses were investigated. Results The CNN predictions had an average correlation coefficient of 0.60 (P < 0.001) with the measured values from SAP and a mean absolute error of 4.25 dB. Simulated RNFL defects led to well-defined arcuate or paracentral visual field losses in the opposite hemifield, which varied according to the location and depth of the simulations.

Artificial Neural Networks are inspired in the brain structure and consist in the interconnection of artificial neurons through artificial synapses in the so-called Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Training these systems requires huge amounts of data and, after the network is trained, it can recognize unforeseen data and provide useful information. As far as the training is concerned, we can distinguish between supervised and unsupervised learning. The former requires labelled data and is based on the iterative minimization of the output error using the stochastic gradient descent method followed by the recalculation of the strength of the synaptic connections (weights) with the backpropagation algorithm. On the other hand, unsupervised learning does not require data labeling and it is not based on explicit output error minimization. Conventional ANNs can function with supervised learning algorithms (perceptrons, multi-layer perceptrons, convolutional networks, etc.) but also with unsupervised learning rules (Kohonen networks, self-organizing maps, etc.). Besides, another type of neural networks are the so-called Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) in which learning takes place through the superposition of voltage spikes launched by the neurons. Their behavior is much closer to the brain functioning mechanisms they can be used with supervised and unsupervised learning rules. Since learning and inference is based on short voltage spikes, energy efficiency improves substantially. Up to this moment, all these ANNs (spiking and conventional) have been implemented as software tools running on conventional computing units based on the von Neumann architecture. However, this approach reaches important limits due to the required computing power, physical size and energy consumption. This is particularly true for applications at the edge of the internet. Thus, there is an increasing interest in developing AI tools directly implemented in hardware for this type of applications. The first hardware demonstrations have been based on Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) circuits and specific communication protocols. However, to further increase training speed andenergy efficiency while reducing the system size, the combination of CMOS neuron circuits with memristor synapses is now being explored. It has also been pointed out that the short time non-volatility of some memristors may even allow fabricating purely memristive ANNs. The memristor is a new device (first demonstrated in solid-state in 2008) which behaves as a resistor with memory and which has been shown to have potentiation and depression properties similar to those of biological synapses. In this Special Issue, we explore the state of the art of neuromorphic circuits implementing neural networks with memristors for AI applications."}, "authors": [{"id": "144369172", "name": "E.

The first focuses on the development of pragmatic tools for increasing the transparency of automatically learned prediction models, as for instance by deep or reinforcement learning. The second is aimed at anticipating the negative impact of opaque models with the desire to regulate or control impactful consequences of incorrect predictions, especially in sensitive areas like medicine and law. The formulation of methods to augment the construction of predictive models with domain knowledge can provide support for producing human understandable explanations for predictions. This runs in parallel with AI regulatory concerns, like the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, which sets standards for the production of explanations from automated or semi-automated decision making.

At the time of this writing, there are as yet no novel antiviral agents or approved vaccines available for deployment as a frontline defense. Understanding the pathobiology of COVID-19 could aid scientists in their discovery of potent antivirals by elucidating unexplored viral pathways. One method for accomplishing this is the leveraging of computational methods to discover new candidate drugs and vaccines in silico. In the last decade, machine learning-based models, trained on specific biomolecules, have offered inexpensive and rapid implementation methods for the discovery of effective viral therapies. Given a target biomolecule, these models are capable of predicting inhibitor candidates in a structural-based manner. If enough data are presented to a model, it can aid the search for a drug or vaccine candidate by identifying patterns within the data. In this review, we focus on the recent advances of COVID-19 drug and vaccine development using artificial intelligence and the potential of intelligent training for the discovery of COVID-19 therapeutics. To facilitate applications of deep learning for SARS-COV-2, we highlight multiple molecular targets of COVID-19, inhibition of which may increase patient survival.

Here we show an all-in-one bionic artificial nerve based on a separate electrical double-layers structure that integrates the functions of perception, recognition, and transmission. The bionic artificial nerve features flexibility, rapid response (<21 ms), high robustness, excellent durability (>10,000 tests), personalized cutability, and no energy consumption when no mechanical stimulation is being applied. The response signals are highly regionally differentiated for the mechanical stimulations, which enables the bionic artificial nerve to mimic the spatiotemporally dynamic logic of a biological neural network. Multifunctional touch interactions demonstrate the enormous potential of the bionic artificial nerve for human-machine hybrid perceptual enhancement. By incorporating the spatiotemporal resolution function and algorithmic analysis, we hope that bionic artificial nerves will promote further development of sophisticated neuroprosthetics and intelligent robotics. Designing artificial sensory neural system for neuroprosthetics and smart robotics applications remains a challenge.

It is a general trend to speak about AI, and many start-ups and established companies are communicating about the development and implementation of AI solutions. Therefore, it is important to consider different perspectives besides the technology and data as the key elements for AI systems. The way in which societies are interacting and organising themselves will change. Such transformations require diverse perspectives from the society and particularly from AI system developers for shaping the humanity of the future. This research aimed to overcome this barrier with the answers for the question: What kind of awareness does the management of AI companies have about the social impact of its AI product or service? The central research question was divided into five sub-questions that were answered by a fundamental literature review and an empirical research study. This covered the management understanding of the terms moral, ethics, and artificial intelligence; the internal company prioritization of moral and ethics; and the involved stakeholders in the AI product or service development. It analysed the known and used ethical AI guidelines and principles. In the end, the social responsibility of the management regarding AI systems was analysed and compared."}, "authors": [{"id": "2036833336", "name": "Josef Baker-Brunnbauer"}], "fields_of_study": ["Sociology", "Computer Science"]}

Several artificial intelligence for ROP approaches have demonstrated adequate proof-of-concept performance in research studies. The next steps are to determine whether these algorithms are robust to variable clinical and technical parameters in practice. Integration of artificial intelligence into ROP screening and treatment is limited by generalizability of the algorithms to maintain performance on unseen data and integration of artificial intelligence technology into new or existing clinical workflows.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nReal-world implementation of artificial intelligence for ROP diagnosis will require massive efforts targeted at developing standards for data acquisition, true external validation, and demonstration of feasibility. We must now focus on ethical, technical, clinical, regulatory, and financial considerations to bring this technology to the infant bedside to realize the promise offered by this technology to reduce preventable blindness from ROP."}, "authors": [{"id": "48674472", "name": "Rebekah H.

The orders of magnitude increase in processing power can then be applied to consuming data at source rather than on the ground allowing the deployment of value-added applications in space, which consume a tiny fraction of the downlink bandwidth that would be otherwise required. The proposed solution has the potential to revolutionize Earth observation (EO) and other remote sensing applications, reducing the time and cost to deploy new added value services to space by a great extent compared with the state of the art.

Selection of the best drug(s) for a patient typically requires the integration of patient data, such as genetics or proteomics, with drug data, like compound chemical descriptors, to score the therapeutic efficacy of drugs. The prediction of drug interactions often relies on similarity metrics, assuming that drugs with similar structures or targets will have comparable behavior or may interfere with each other. Optimizing the dosage schedule for administration of drugs is performed using mathematical models to interpret pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data. The recently developed and powerful models for each of these tasks are addressed, explained, and analyzed here. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology Volume 60 is January 9, 2020.

Compared with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, there is an issue of high observer variation in the interpretation of echocardiograms. Therefore, AI can help minimize the observer variation and provide accurate diagnosis in the field of echocardiography. In this review, we summarize the necessity for automated diagnosis in the echocardiographic field, and discuss the results of AI application to echocardiography and future perspectives. Currently, there are two roles for AI in cardiovascular imaging. One is the automation of tasks performed by humans, such as image segmentation, measurement of cardiac structural and functional parameters. The other is the discovery of clinically important insights. Most reported applications were focused on the automation of tasks. Moreover, algorithms that can obtain cardiac measurements are also being reported. In the next stage, AI can be expected to expand and enrich existing knowledge. With the continual evolution of technology, cardiologists should become well versed in this new knowledge of AI and be able to harness it as a tool. AI can be incorporated into everyday clinical practice and become a valuable aid for many healthcare professionals dealing with cardiovascular diseases."}, "authors": [{"id": "1879903", "name": "K.

Our objective is to describe a more valuable characteristic of digital therapeutics, which is distinct from traditional medicine or therapy: that is, the utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning systems to monitor and predict individual patient symptom data in an adaptive clinical feedback loop via digital biomarkers to provide a precision medicine approach to healthcare. Artificial intelligence platforms can learn and predict effective interventions for individuals using a multitude of personal variables to provide a customized and more tailored therapy regimen. Digital therapeutics coupled with artificial intelligence and machine learning also allows more effective clinical observations and management at the population level for various health conditions and cohorts. This vital differentiation of digital therapeutics compared to other forms of therapeutics enables a more personalized form of healthcare that actively adapts to patients’ individual clinical needs, goals, and lifestyles.

Purchasing prices can be improved by inducing competition in the supply base. In this context, the application of mechanism design theory in negotiations gained enhanced attention. While such approaches can result in high cost reductions, mechanism design-based negotiations are very complex. The paper aims at answering the question whether artificial intelligence (AI) can facilitate the execution of mechanism design-based negotiations. To this end, a World Café has been conducted at an automotive original equipment manufacturer. A group of 20 experts from the fields of purchasing and AI discussed the potentials of AI for the purchasing function. The results indicate that the application of AI can indeed facilitate the execution of mechanism design-based negotiations and help overcoming bounded rationality problems.

Among these approaches, computational studies making this feasible are rapidly progressing in particular and have been widely applied in epilepsy. These computational studies are being conducted in two main streams: 1) artificial intelligence-based studies implementing computational machines with specific functions, such as automatic diagnosis and prognosis prediction for an individual patient, using machine learning techniques based on large amounts of data obtained from multiple patients and 2) patient-specific modeling-based studies implementing biophysical in-silico platforms to understand pathological mechanisms and derive the optimal treatment for each patient by reproducing the brain network dynamics of the particular patient per se based on individual patient’s data.

Countries such as China, India, Kenya, Mexico, Russia, and the UAE have released AI strategy documents (https://www.strategybusiness.com/blog/Is-AI-the-Next-Frontier-forNational-Competitive-Advantage?gko1⁄4931c6). Others have developed broader visions to transform their economies using 4IR technologies (https://www.iol.co.za/business-report/ economy/wef-africa-botswana-tells-the-world-itwants-to-reduce-dependence-on-diamonds31998283). There is, however, a wide variation among developing countries in the development of the AI industry. China is a clear global leader. Most other countries perform poorly in the main ingredients needed for building high-quality AI applications such as big data, computing power and manpower. Nonetheless, the AI ecosystem is gradually emerging in these countries."}, "authors": [{"id": "1774804", "name": "N. Kshetri"}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Business"]}

In this article, we have tried to evaluate the role of artificial intelligence in lung cancer screening, as well as the future potential and efficiency of AI in the classification of nodules. The relevant studies between 2010-2020 were selected from the PubMed database after excluding animal studies and were analyzed for the contribution of AI. Techniques such as deep learning and machine learning allow automatic characterization and classification of nodules with high precision and promise an advanced lung cancer screening method in the future. Even though several combination models with high performance have been proposed, an effectively validated model for routine use still needs to be improvised. Combining the performance of artificial intelligence with a radiologist's expertise offers a successful outcome with higher accuracy.

Location update and paging costs directly affect the cost to the service provider. When the size of the Mobile Switching Centre (MSC) is large, the paging cost becomes maximum. Though, no location update is required for this case. On the contrary, paging cost shoots high if each cell forms individual LA, but in this case, location update cost shoots to the maximum value. Therefore, deducing the network to the optimal amount of LA's is an intractable combinatorial optimization problem. In this paper, we intend to optimize the partitions of the MSC service area into an optimal number of LA, to curtail the total location management cost. We propose a novel scheme bearing in mind cell attributes of the network to deduce an optimum number of location areas, leading to minimum cost per call. It is revealed by the results of this work, attained after simulating the scenario on MATLAB 2018a that Cell Attributes Based Algorithm is a very promising scheme for cellular networks, and it outperforms the existing algorithms in a practical scenario."}, "authors": [{"id": "143777630", "name": "Vrince Vimal"}, {"id": "2112767832", "name": "Teekam Singh"}, {"id": "121403056", "name": "S.

Contemporary MOOC learning analytics relate with click-streams, keystrokes and other user-input variables. Such variables however, do not always capture users’ learning and behavior (e.g., passive video watching). In this paper, we present a study with 40 students who watched a MOOC lecture while their eye-movements were being recorded. We then proposed a method to define stimuli-based gaze variables that can be used for any kind of stimulus. The proposed stimuli-based gaze variables indicate students’ content-coverage (in space and time) and reading processes (area of interest based variables) and attention (i.e., with-me-ness), at the perceptual (following teacher’s deictic acts) and conceptual levels (following teacher discourse). In our experiment, we identified a significant mediation effect of the content coverage, reading patterns and the two levels of with-me-ness on the relation between students’ motivation and their learning performance. Such variables enable common measurements for the different kind of stimuli present in distinct MOOCs. Our long-term goal is to create student profiles based on their performance and learning strategy using stimuli-based gaze variables and to provide students gaze-aware feedback to improve overall learning process. One key ingredient in the process of achieving a high level of adaptation in providing gaze-aware feedback to the students is to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for prediction of student performance from their behaviour. In this contribution, we also present a method combining state-of-the-art AI technique with the eye-tracking data to predict student performance.

Together, we firmly believe that these technologies will transform virtually all service sectors. Especially the advent of service robotics (virtual and physical service robots) in combination with these technologies will lead to rapid innovation that has the potential to dramatically improve the customer experience, service quality, and productivity all at the same time (Wirtz and Zeithaml 2018). Automated service interactions enable individually tailored, more efficient as well as effective services.

This research aims at exploring potential regulatory mechanisms and identifying immunogenic prognostic markers for BC, which were used to construct a prognostic signature for disease-free survival (DFS) of BC based on artificial intelligence algorithms. Differentially expressed immune genes were identified between normal tissues and tumor tissues. Univariate Cox regression identified potential prognostic immune genes. Thirty-four transcription factors and 34 immune genes were used to develop an immune regulatory network. The artificial intelligence survival prediction system was developed based on three artificial intelligence algorithms. Multivariate Cox analyses determined 17 immune genes (ADAMTS8, IFNG, XG, APOA5, SIAH2, C2CD2, STAR, CAMP, CDH19, NTSR1, PCDHA1, AMELX, FREM1, CLEC10A, CD1B, CD6, and LTA) as prognostic biomarkers for BC. A prognostic nomogram was constructed on these prognostic genes. Concordance indexes were 0.782, 0.734, and 0.735 for 1-, 3-, and 5- year DFS. The DFS in high-risk group was significantly worse than that in low-risk group. Artificial intelligence survival prediction system provided three individual mortality risk predictive curves based on three artificial intelligence algorithms. In conclusion, comprehensive bioinformatics identified 17 immune genes as potential prognostic biomarkers, which might be potential candidates of immunotherapy targets in BC patients. The current study depicted regulatory network between transcription factors and immune genes, which was helpful to deepen the understanding of immune regulatory mechanisms for BC cancer. Two artificial intelligence survival predictive systems are available at https://zhangzhiqiao7.shinyapps.io/Smart_Cancer_Survival_Predictive_System_16_BC_C1005/ and https://zhangzhiqiao8.shinyapps.io/Gene_Survival_Subgroup_Analysis_16_BC_C1005/.

A summary describing the area is generated from inferences made on the recorded statistics. The CNN is able to predict the land and development distribution with an accuracy of 95.1%. The decision tree predicts rural areas with a precision of 99.6% and recall of 88.9%. The statistics obtained for a dataset of more than 1000 villages in India are cross-validated against the Census of India 2011 data.

Although the incorporation of artificial intelligence in libraries can be perceived to alienate librarians from their users, it will probably help libraries do more rather than taking over the jobs of librarians. It will enhance their services delivery. Artificial intelligence will greatly improve library operations and services and will upgrade and heighten the relevance of libraries in an ever-changing digital society."}, "authors": [{"id": "151400199", "name": "I.

As a result, the need is growing for reliable and efficient noninvasive tools to measure body composition. Traditional methods of estimating body composition, anthropomorphic measurements, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and bioelectrical impedance, are limited in their application. Cross-sectional imaging remains the reference standard for body composition analysis and is accomplished through segmentation of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies. However, manual segmentation of images by an expert reader is labor intensive and time consuming, limiting its implementation in large-scale studies and in routine clinical practice. In this review, novel methods to automate the process of body composition measurement are discussed including the application of artificial intelligence and deep learning to tissue segmentation."}, "authors": [{"id": "2109253436", "name": "Benjamin Wang"}, {"id": "4613293", "name": "M.

For these systems to make a meaningful contribution to healthcare globally, they must be trusted by patients and healthcare professionals alike, and service the needs of patients in diverse regions and segments of the population. We developed an AI virtual assistant which provides patients with triage and diagnostic information. Crucially, the system is based on a generative model, which allows for relatively straightforward re-parameterization to reflect local disease and risk factor burden in diverse regions and population segments. This is an appealing property, particularly when considering the potential of AI systems to improve the provision of healthcare on a global scale in many regions and for both developing and developed countries. We performed a prospective validation study of the accuracy and safety of the AI system and human doctors. Importantly, we assessed the accuracy and safety of both the AI and human doctors independently against identical clinical cases and, unlike previous studies, also accounted for the information gathering process of both agents. Overall, we found that the AI system is able to provide patients with triage and diagnostic information with a level of clinical accuracy and safety comparable to that of human doctors. Through this approach and study, we hope to start building trust in AI-powered systems by directly comparing their performance to human doctors, who do not always agree with each other on the cause of patients’ symptoms or the most appropriate triage recommendation."}, "authors": [{"id": "152814697", "name": "Adam Baker"}, {"id": "2851128", "name": "Yura N.

Background: Deep learning algorithms derived in homogeneous populations may be poorly generalizable and have the potential to reflect, perpetuate, and even exacerbate racial/ethnic disparities in health and health care. In this study, we aimed to (1) assess whether the performance of a deep learning algorithm designed to detect low left ventricular ejection fraction using the 12-lead ECG varies by race/ethnicity and to (2) determine whether its performance is determined by the derivation population or by racial variation in the ECG. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis that included 97 829 patients with paired ECGs and echocardiograms. We tested the model performance by race/ethnicity for convolutional neural network designed to identify patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35% from the 12-lead ECG. Results: The convolutional neural network that was previously derived in a homogeneous population (derivation cohort, n=44 959; 96.2% non-Hispanic white) demonstrated consistent performance to detect low left ventricular ejection fraction across a range of racial/ethnic subgroups in a separate testing cohort (n=52 870): non-Hispanic white (n=44 524; area under the curve [AUC], 0.931), Asian (n=557; AUC, 0.961), black/African American (n=651; AUC, 0.937), Hispanic/Latino (n=331; AUC, 0.937), and American Indian/Native Alaskan (n=223; AUC, 0.938). In secondary analyses, a separate neural network was able to discern racial subgroup category (black/African American [AUC, 0.84], and white, non-Hispanic [AUC, 0.76] in a 5-class classifier), and a network trained only in non-Hispanic whites from the original derivation cohort performed similarly well across a range of racial/ethnic subgroups in the testing cohort with an AUC of at least 0.930 in all racial/ethnic subgroups. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that while ECG characteristics vary by race, this did not impact the ability of a convolutional neural network to predict low left ventricular ejection fraction from the ECG. We recommend reporting of performance among diverse ethnic, racial, age, and sex groups for all new artificial intelligence tools to ensure responsible use of artificial intelligence in medicine."}, "authors": [{"id": "6995238", "name": "P.

The main methods of research are systemic, scenario, and case analyses. The authors maintain that PS threats, both national and international, created by the malicious use of AI should be considered at three levels. At the first level, a false negative image of AI is spread. The second level of PS threats is directly related to the malicious use of AI (MUAI), but an attack on public consciousness is not its main goal. The MUAI designed primarily to cause psychological damage belongs to the third, and highest, level of PS threats. Synthetic AI products (combining a number of technologies, which can increase the damage from their hacking or malicious use) create a whole range of new risks and threats to BRICS countries. The reorientation of commercial AI systems, the malicious use of deepfakes and chatbots, the use of bots to set agendas, deranking, and AI phishing technologies also pose a threat. The main methods of destructive impact through MUAI are illustrated by the examples China, India, and Russia. BRICS policy documents state readiness for joint action against the MUAI. At this point bilateral agreements play the leading role in the development of AI cooperation of BRICS member states, but their declarations clearly state the intention to join forces against the misuse of information and communications technology (ICT). National regulation pertaining to AI and efforts to counter its malicious use are still at the fledgling stage in most countries. This makes it all the more important for each of the BRICS member states to develop international cooperation and share experience. BRICS’s potential in this sphere is still very far from being fully tapped."}, "authors": [{"id": "2337823310", "name": "D. Bazarkina"}, {"id": "108248101", "name": "E.

With rising computing power, the discussion of AI usefulness has been refuelled by new powerful algorithms and, in particular, the availability of the internet as a vast resource of unstructured data. This gives hope to construction management in particular, since construction projects are recently becoming larger and more complex, i.e. encompassing more and more participants focusing on diverging interests while the given frames of time and budget are getting tighter. Finally, construction management is used to establish an efficient organisation of all these issues and able to predict the result with a high degree of precision and certainty. This could be accomplished by the human mind when projects were smaller, but with the recent development human mind is clearly pushed to its limits. On this background, the possible support of AI to organisational tasks needs to be investigated on a theoretical level prior to developing tools. This paper is the extended version of the article ‘Artificial Intelligence in Construction Management – a Perspective’, presented at the Creative Construction Conference 2019 where the algorithmic and entropic scope of AI is investigated in the context of construction management. However, efficient organisation is about restructuring systems into a set of well-separated subsystems, where human intelligence is required to bring in mainly two higher principles which AI fails to provide: the ability to prioritise and creativity allowing for new approaches not derived from given data. This paper additionally focuses on the aspect of in-situ coordination. This service is an aspect of organisation which is not separable and can therefore only be treated as self-determined subsystem, located outside of hierarchical control. At this point algorithms of AI need to be investigated not so much as to substitute human mind but to provide significant support."}, "authors": [{"id": "9376357", "name": "W.

Automating the molecular design-make-test-analyze cycle accelerates hit and lead finding for drug discovery. Using deep learning for molecular design and a microfluidics platform for on-chip chemical synthesis, liver X receptor (LXR) agonists were generated from scratch. The computational pipeline was tuned to explore the chemical space of known LXRα agonists and generate novel molecular candidates. To ensure compatibility with automated on-chip synthesis, the chemical space was confined to the virtual products obtainable from 17 one-step reactions. Twenty-five de novo designs were successfully synthesized in flow. In vitro screening of the crude reaction products revealed 17 (68%) hits, with up to 60-fold LXR activation. The batch resynthesis, purification, and retesting of 14 of these compounds confirmed that 12 of them were potent LXR agonists. These results support the suitability of the proposed design-make-test-analyze framework as a blueprint for automated drug design with artificial intelligence and miniaturized bench-top synthesis."}, "authors": [{"id": "3674456", "name": "F.

This paper presents a scoping review of the scientific literature from the past 12 years (2008-2020) to identify which methodologies, techniques, algorithms and frameworks are used in Artificial Intelligence and Affective Computing for pregnancy health and well-being. The methodology proposed by Arksey and O’Malley, in conjunction with PRISMA-ScR framework has been used to create this review. Despite the relevance that emotional status can have as a risk factor during pregnancy, one of the main findings of this study is that there is still not a significant amount of literature on automatic analysis of emotion.

Noncontrast computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can both be used to distinguish between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, which is difficult based on clinical features. Hypodensity on CT and DWI hyperintensity on MRI identifies irreversibly damaged tissue, although the sensitivity of MRI is higher in the acute setting. Angiographic and perfusion imaging sequences can identify a large vessel occlusion and, along with perfusion imaging, can select patients for endovascular therapy. The FLAIR-DWI mismatch yields information about patients with unknown time of onset (including wake-up strokes). Stroke imaging also gives insight into prognosis, with current methods aiming to give a picture of the short-term consequences of successful reperfusion or continued large vessel occlusion. One important caveat about stroke imaging is that it must be done quickly, as faster treatment leads to better outcomes.1 However, most steps in the stroke imaging triage pathway require the presence of human radiologists and neurologists, and this is often the time-limiting step. The expertise required for these tasks may not be available at all sites or at all times. Therefore, there is interest in automated methods for stroke imaging evaluation. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad term reflecting the use of computers to perform tasks that humans may find difficult, often in ways that are hard to pinpoint. For example, although humans find high-level computation difficult, calculator technology is not considered AI because we know how to break this down into discrete steps and feel we understand it. However, facial recognition is a task that humans perform well, but an algorithm to identify faces is usually considered AI since we cannot articulate precisely how this is done. Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI in which algorithms learn from the data itself without explicit programming. ML methods reflect a broad range of statistical techniques ranging from linear regression to more complex methods such as support vector machines and decision trees. ML methods can be further broken into supervised and unsupervised learning, which differ from one another in that the former requires access to gold standard labels although the latter attempts to find the answers implicitly in the data itself. While ML methods have grown more popular over recent years, the advent of a specific supervised ML method based on architectures resembling human neural networks over the past decade has led to a quantum leap in performance.2 This method, called deep learning (DL) because of many multiple internal layers, can be considered a transformative technology. Compared with previous methods that required humans to identify image features, a deep neural network trained on a dataset with known outputs can learn the best features for organizing the data. In this review, we will discuss ML methods applied to stroke imaging with an emphasis on DL applications.

To capture the complementary benefits of artificial and human intelligence beyond mere cost savings, firms do not only need to enhance their advanced analytics while continuing to develop their human intelligence. Rather, they additionally need a meta-intelligence for transforming their intelligence architecture in line with corporate strategy. Consequently, the firms need intelligence3 – comprising AI, human intelligence and the meta-intelligence.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe new concept of a meta-intelligence for renewing and recombining artificial and human intelligence helps to reconcile diverse findings in prior research. Without this meta-intelligence, most AI initiatives will be isolated endeavors, which may have positive effects but likely will not live up to the expectations.\n"}, "authors": [{"id": "1863845", "name": "U.

For example, artificial intelligence influences the behavior of tourists and tourism enterprises. The analysis of the impact of artificial intelligence on the tourism industry as a system is still insufficient. Therefore, this research proposes a multi-dimensional framework from an industry perspective based on the existing definition of artificial intelligence. The framework involves three aspects: the level of intelligence, task types, and whether artificial intelligence is embedded in robots. The authors use a large number of Chinese practice cases to investigate how AI affects the tourism industry, then put forward a research agenda to analyze how destination government, tourism enterprises and tourist experience will change in the future.

Based on the literature, an artificial intelligence–based architecture is proposed and sketched.FindingsThe findings show that there are many gaps in supporting students with ID/DD through the utilization of artificial intelligence. Given that the majority of students with ID/DD often have serious and chronic and comorbid health conditions, the potential use of health information in artificial intelligence is even more critical. Therefore, there is a clear need to develop a system that facilitates communication and access to health information for students with ID/DD, one that provides information to caregivers and education providers, limits errors, and, therefore, improves these individuals' education and quality of life.Practical implicationsThis review highlights the gap in the current literature regarding using artificial intelligence in supporting the education of students with ID/DD. There is an urgent need for an intelligent system in collaboration with the updated health information to improve the quality of services submitted for people with intellectual disabilities and as a result improving their quality of life.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the literature by highlighting the gaps in incorporating artificial intelligence and its service to individuals with ID/DD. The research additionally proposes a solution based on the confounding variables of students’ health and individual characteristics. This solution will provide an automated information flow as a functional diagnostic and intervention tool for teachers, caregivers and parents. It could potentially improve the educational and practical outcomes for individuals with ID/DD and, ultimately, their quality of life."}, "authors": [{"id": "2385751", "name": "Faten F.

Its fast development is powered by theoretical advancement, big data, computer hardware (e.g., the graphics processing unit, or GPU), and high-performance computing platforms that support the development, training, and deployment of AI models within a reasonable amount of time. Recent years have witnessed significant advances in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), which is the integration of geospatial studies and AI, especially machine learning and deep learning methods and the latest AI technologies in both academia and industry. GeoAI can be regarded as a study subject to develop intelligent computer programs to mimic the processes of human perception, spatial reasoning, and discovery about geographical phenomena and dynamics; to advance our knowledge; and to solve problems in human environmental systems and their interactions, with a focus on spatial contexts and roots in geography or geographic information science (GIScience). Thus, it would require the knowledge of AI theory, programming and computation practices as well as geographic domain knowledge to be competent in GeoAI research. There have already been increasingly collaborative GeoAI studies for GIScience, remote sensing, physical environment, and human society. It is a good time to provide a key reference list for educators, students, researchers, and practitioners to keep up with the latest GeoAI research topics. This bibliographical entry will first review the historical roots for AI in geography and GIScience and then list up to ten selective recent works with annotations that briefly describe their importance for each topic of interest in the GeoAI landscape, ranging from fundamental spatial representation learning to spatial predictions and to various advancements in cartography, earth observation, social sensing, and geospatial semantics."}, "authors": [{"id": "2116500359", "name": "Song Gao"}], "fields_of_study": null}

Indeed, determining whether and how artificial intelligence might contribute to reducing or exacerbating health inequities has been identified as a priority research area by several stakeholders and by numerous ethics and policy guidance documents.2–4 Understanding the connection between health inequities and artificial intelligence should be a priority when deploying these technologies in public health. Since public health activities typically target populations instead of individuals and require collective action instead of individual intervention,5 introducing artificial intelligence technologies to support these activities may influence (either positively or negatively, intentionally or unintentionally) health inequities more than in other areas. As such, identifying the distinctive equity considerations and dimensions that might emerge in the public health context is critical. However, doing so is not a straightforward task. First, we cannot simply look to past technological innovations to determine which health equity considerations or implications might arise with the use of artificial intelligence in public health because technological innovations and their diffusion in health systems each produce or interact with health inequities in novel ways.1 We may not be able to assume that the trends or pathways that create or prevent inequities will be the same when implementing artificial intelligence technologies as they are with other technological innovations. This limitation may be particularly challenging with artificial intelligence technologies given their use of big data and machine learning. Second, artificial intelligence represents a vast and sometimes contested area of study and application. Here we define artificial intelligence as a branch of computer science that explores the ability of computers to imitate aspects of intelligent human behaviour, such as problem-solving, reasoning and recognition.2 Technologies that are supported by artificial intelligence are therefore numerous, and include natural language processing, object recognition and reinforcement learning, among others. The ways in which these technologies might be deployed in public health are equally numerous, including digital disease surveillance, machine learning to predict incidences of noncommunicable diseases, and others. Finally, given that health inequities are often defined as differences in health that are unjust, even what should be counted as health inequities and what it means to achieve health equity may differ according to the nature of the new technology, how it is or has been integrated into health systems and our judgements about its interaction with the public’s health.6 As a result, before research or health system interventions in this area are developed or implemented, we should first seek to conceptually map the unique ways in which inequities might manifest when artificial intelligence is implemented or used in public health. Indeed, important work examining the unique equity dimensions associated with specific artificial intelligence technologies in this area has begun.7 Yet, we posit that there are general equity considerations and dimensions that can be identified and used as starting points for the reflection of equitable artificial intelligence in public health, and that it would be of benefit for the field to have these identified and enumerated. We will briefly describe four key equity considerations and dimensions and conclude by discussing how they can be used as starting points to further understand and enhance the equitable deployment of artificial intelligence in public health."}, "authors": [{"id": "2110001853", "name": "Maxwell J.

There remains an 'artificial intelligence chasm' in the spheres of validation, regulation, safe implementation, and demonstration of clinical impact that needs to be bridged before the full potential of artificial intelligence to deliver PHC can be realized.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nOphthalmology is currently in a stage between the demonstration of the potential of artificial intelligence and widespread deployment. Next stages include aggregating and curating datasets, training and validating artificial intelligence systems, establishing the regulatory framework, implementation and adoption with ongoing evaluation and model adjustment, and finally, meaningful human-artificial intelligence interaction with clinically validated tools that have demonstrated measurable impact on patient and healthcare system outcomes. Ophthalmologists should leverage the ability of artificial intelligence systems to glean insights from large volumes of multivariate data, and to interpret artificial intelligence recommendations in a clinical context. In doing so, the field will be well positioned to lead the transformation of health care in a personalized direction.

This article reviews advances in the use of artificial intelligence for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of urinary stone disease over the last 2 years. Pertinent studies were identified via a nonsystematic review of the literature performed using MEDLINE and the Cochrane database. Recent findings Twelve articles have been published, which met the inclusion criteria. This included three articles in the detection and diagnosis of stones, six in the prediction of postprocedural outcomes including percutaneous nephrolithotomy and shock wave lithotripsy, and three in the use of artificial intelligence in prevention of stone disease by predicting patients at risk of stones, detecting the stone type via digital photographs and detecting risk factors in patients most at risk of not attending outpatient appointments. Summary Our knowledge of artificial intelligence in urology has greatly advanced in the last 2 years. Its role currently is to aid the endourologist as opposed to replacing them. However, the ability of artificial intelligence to efficiently process vast quantities of data, in combination with the shift towards electronic patient records provides increasingly more ‘big data’ sets. This will allow artificial intelligence to analyse and detect novel diagnostic and treatment patterns in the future."}, "authors": [{"id": "4597106", "name": "Bob Yang"}, {"id": "2043221", "name": "D.

Pace current clinical practice, I argue that, under certain circumstances, these risks do need to be disclosed. Otherwise, the physician either vitiates a patient’s informed consent or violates a more general obligation to warn him about potentially harmful consequences. To support this view, I argue, first, that the already widely accepted conditions in the evaluation of risks, i.e. the ‘nature’ and ‘likelihood’ of risks, speak in favour of disclosure and, second, that principled objections against the disclosure of these risks do not withstand scrutiny. Moreover, I also explain that these risks are exacerbated by pandemics like the COVID-19 crisis, which further emphasises their significance."}, "authors": [{"id": "118210277", "name": "Maximilian Kiener"}], "fields_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"]}

In this review, we summarize recent developments in the application of artificial intelligence algorithms for estimating the risks of malignancy in a thyroid nodule. Recent findings Artificial intelligence have been used to predict malignancy in thyroid nodules using ultrasound images, cytopathology images, and molecular markers. Recent clinical trials have shown that artificial intelligence model's performance matched that of experienced radiologists and pathologists. Explainable artificial intelligence models are being developed to avoid the black box problem. Risk stratification algorithms using artificial intelligence for thyroid nodules are now commercially available in many countries.

Within ophthalmology, artificial intelligence technology has found ways of improving the diagnostic and therapeutic processes in cornea, glaucoma, retina, and cataract surgery. As demands on the modern ophthalmologist grow, artificial intelligence can be utilized to help address increased demands of modern medicine and ophthalmology by adding to the physician's clinical and surgical acumen. The purpose of this review is to highlight the integration of artificial intelligence into ophthalmology in recent years in the areas of cornea, refractive, and cataract surgery.\n\n\nRECENT FINDINGS\nWithin the realms of cornea, refractive, and cataract surgery, artificial intelligence has played a major role in identifying ways of improving diagnostic detection. In keratoconus, artificial intelligence algorithms may help with the early detection of keratoconus and other ectatic disorders. In cataract surgery, artificial intelligence may help improve the performance of intraocular lens (IOL) calculation formulas. Further, with its potential integration into automated refraction devices, artificial intelligence can help provide an improved framework for IOL formula optimization that is more accurate and customized to a specific cataract surgeon.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nThe future of artificial intelligence in ophthalmology is a promising prospect. With continued advancement of mathematical and computational algorithms, corneal disease processes can be diagnosed sooner and IOL calculations can be made more accurate."}, "authors": [{"id": "34036475", "name": "Aazim A Siddiqui"}, {"id": "5441290", "name": "J.

The use of Bitcoin has vastly grown as a financial asset rather than just a tool for online payments. A lot of cryptocurrencies have been created since 2011 with Bitcoin dominating the cryptocurrencies’ market. With plenty of cryptocurrencies being used as financial assets and with millions of trades being executed through different exchange services, cryptocurrencies are susceptible to trading problems and challenges similar to those traditionally encountered in the financial domain. Price and trend prediction, volatility prediction, portfolio construction and fraud detection are some examples related to trading. In addition, there are other challenges that are specific to the domain of cryptocurrencies such as mining, cybersecurity, anonymity and privacy. In this paper, we survey the application of artificial intelligence techniques to address these challenges for cryptocurrencies with their vast amount of daily transactions, trades and news that are beyond human capabilities to analyze and learn from.

Since then, the development of artificial intelligence has in part been shaped by the field of neuroscience. By understanding the human brain, scientists have attempted to build new intelligent machines capable of performing complex tasks akin to humans. Indeed, future research into artificial intelligence will continue to benefit from the study of the human brain. While the development of artificial intelligence algorithms has been fast paced, the actual use of most artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in biomedical engineering and clinical practice is still markedly below its conceivably broader potentials. This is partly because for any algorithm to be incorporated into existing workflows it has to stand the test of scientific validation, clinical and personal utility, application context, and is equitable as well. In this context, there is much to be gained by combining AI and human intelligence (HI). Harnessing Big Data, computing power and storage capacities, and addressing societal issues emergent from algorithm applications, demand deploying HI in tandem with AI. Very few countries, even economically developed states, lack adequate and critical governance frames to best understand and steer the AI innovation trajectories in health care. Drug discovery and translational pharmaceutical research stand to gain from AI technology provided they are also informed by HI. In this expert review, we analyze the ways in which AI applications are likely to traverse the continuum of life from birth to death, and encompassing not only humans but also all animal, plant, and other living organisms that are increasingly touched by AI. Examples of AI applications include digital health, diagnosis of diseases in newborns, remote monitoring of health by smart devices, real-time Big Data analytics for prompt diagnosis of heart attacks, and facial analysis software with consequences on civil liberties. While we underscore the need for integration of AI and HI, we note that AI technology does not have to replace medical specialists or scientists and rather, is in need of such expert HI. Altogether, AI and HI offer synergy for responsible innovation and veritable prospects for improving health care from prevention to diagnosis to therapeutics while unintended consequences of automation emergent from AI and algorithms should be borne in mind on scientific cultures, work force, and society at large."}, "authors": [{"id": "4918603", "name": "Kevin Dzobo"}, {"id": "151198637", "name": "Sampson Adotey"}, {"id": "33714523", "name": "N.

Wittke attempts to provide a basic framework of what constitutes AI as well as to assess its impact on the Information Economy. What happens in case of rising mass unemployment or social inequality? What will be the effect on labor as a value system for today’s societies? Could the entire notion of capitalism be questioned in the wake of AI?

The emulation of human skin via flexible and stretchable electronics gives rise to electronic skin (e‐skin), which has realized artificial sensation and other functions that cannot be achieved by conventional electronics. To date, tremendous progress has been made in data acquisition and transmission for e‐skin systems, while the implementation of perception within systems, that is, sensory data processing, is still in its infancy. Integrating the perception functionality into a flexible and stretchable sensing system, namely artificial skin perception, is critical to endow current e‐skin systems with higher intelligence. Here, recent progress in the design and fabrication of artificial skin perception devices and systems is summarized, and challenges and prospects are discussed. The strategies for implementing artificial skin perception utilize either conventional silicon‐based circuits or novel flexible computing devices such as memristive devices and synaptic transistors, which enable artificial skin to surpass human skin, with a distributed, low‐latency, and energy‐efficient information‐processing ability.

Likewise, blockchain is very safe to apply because it encrypts and verifies these medical data in case they are hacked or leaked. These technologies are considered very important. This study raises the problems of these artificial intelligence blockchains and recognizes blockchain, artificial intelligence, neural networks, healthcare, etc.; these problems clearly exist, so systems like EHR are not being used. In the future, ensuring privacy will be made easier when these EHRs are activated and data transmission and data verification between hospitals are completed. To overcome these shortcomings, we define an information security blockchain artificial intelligence framework and verify blockchain systems for accurate extraction, storage, and verification of data.

In this Perspective we seek to distil how many of deep learning’s failures can be seen as different symptoms of the same underlying problem: shortcut learning. Shortcuts are decision rules that perform well on standard benchmarks but fail to transfer to more challenging testing conditions, such as real-world scenarios. Related issues are known in comparative psychology, education and linguistics, suggesting that shortcut learning may be a common characteristic of learning systems, biological and artificial alike. Based on these observations, we develop a set of recommendations for model interpretation and benchmarking, highlighting recent advances in machine learning to improve robustness and transferability from the lab to real-world applications. Deep learning has resulted in impressive achievements, but under what circumstances does it fail, and why?

As both phenomena involve non-human goal-directed agents that can make a difference to the social world, they raise some similar moral and regulatory challenges, which require us to rethink some of our anthropocentric moral assumptions. Are humans always responsible for those entities’ actions, or could the entities bear responsibility themselves? Could the entities engage in normative reasoning? Could they even have rights and a moral status? I will tentatively defend the (increasingly widely held) view that, under certain conditions, artificial intelligent systems, like corporate entities, might qualify as responsible moral agents and as holders of limited rights and legal personhood. I will further suggest that regulators should permit the use of autonomous artificial systems in high-stakes settings only if they are engineered to function as moral (not just intentional) agents and/or there is some liability-transfer arrangement in place. I will finally raise the possibility that if artificial systems ever became phenomenally conscious, there might be a case for extending a stronger moral status to them, but argue that, as of now, this remains very hypothetical."}, "authors": [{"id": "96487046", "name": "M.

To control the spread of the disease, screening large numbers of suspected cases for appropriate quarantine and treatment are a priority. Pathogenic laboratory testing is typically the gold standard, but it bears the burden of significant false negativity, adding to the urgent need of alternative diagnostic methods to combat the disease. Based on COVID-19 radiographic changes in CT images, this study hypothesized that artificial intelligence methods might be able to extract specific graphical features of COVID-19 and provide a clinical diagnosis ahead of the pathogenic test, thus saving critical time for disease control. We collected 1065 CT images of pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 cases along with those previously diagnosed with typical viral pneumonia. We modified the inception transfer-learning model to establish the algorithm, followed by internal and external validation. The internal validation achieved a total accuracy of 89.5% with a specificity of 0.88 and sensitivity of 0.87. The external testing dataset showed a total accuracy of 79.3% with a specificity of 0.83 and sensitivity of 0.67. In addition, in 54 COVID-19 images, the first two nucleic acid test results were negative, and 46 were predicted as COVID-19 positive by the algorithm, with an accuracy of 85.2%.

In this paper, we introduce a framework for algorithmic auditing that supports artificial intelligence system development end-to-end, to be applied throughout the internal organization development life-cycle. Each stage of the audit yields a set of documents that together form an overall audit report, drawing on an organization's values or principles to assess the fit of decisions made throughout the process.

Today, human chat service agents are frequently replaced by conversational software agents or chatbots, which are systems designed to communicate with human users by means of natural language often based on artificial intelligence (AI). Though cost- and time-saving opportunities triggered a widespread implementation of AI-based chatbots, they still frequently fail to meet customer expectations, potentially resulting in users being less inclined to comply with requests made by the chatbot. Drawing on social response and commitment-consistency theory, we empirically examine through a randomized online experiment how verbal anthropomorphic design cues and the foot-in-the-door technique affect user request compliance. Our results demonstrate that both anthropomorphism as well as the need to stay consistent significantly increase the likelihood that users comply with a chatbot’s request for service feedback.

Administering novel experimental treatments to a large representative sample of the United Kingdom population allowed us to compare people’s evaluations of deepfakes. We find that people are more likely to feel uncertain than to be misled by deepfakes, but this resulting uncertainty, in turn, reduces trust in news on social media.

As AI advances to a higher intelligence level, more human service employees and human intelligence (HI) at the intelligence levels lower than that level should be used less. Thus, at the current level of AI development, mechanical service should be performed mostly by mechanical AI, thinking service by both thinking AI and HI, and feeling service mostly by HI. Mechanical AI should be used for standardization when service is routine and transactional, for cost leadership, and mostly at the service delivery stage. Thinking AI should be used for personalization when service is data-rich and utilitarian, for quality leadership, and mostly at the service creation stage. Feeling AI should be used for relationalization when service is relational and high touch, for relationship leadership, and mostly at the service interaction stage.

In this paper, we focus on a challenging but practical few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) problem. FSCIL requires CNN models to incrementally learn new classes from very few labelled samples, without forgetting the previously learned ones. To address this problem, we represent the knowledge using a neural gas (NG) network, which can learn and preserve the topology of the feature manifold formed by different classes. On this basis, we propose the TOpology-Preserving knowledge InCrementer (TOPIC) framework. TOPIC mitigates the forgetting of the old classes by stabilizing NG's topology and improves the representation learning for few-shot new classes by growing and adapting NG to new training samples. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art class-incremental learning methods on CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and CUB200 datasets."}, "authors": [{"id": "48391855", "name": "Xiaoyu Tao"}, {"id": "46761465", "name": "Xiaopeng Hong"}, {"id": "49214288", "name": "Xinyuan Chang"}, {"id": "2106681370", "name": "Songlin Dong"}, {"id": "2027351487", "name": "Xing Wei"}, {"id": "144768792", "name": "Yihong Gong"}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"]}

However, medical imaging presents unique challenges that confront DL approaches. In this survey article, we first present traits of medical imaging, highlight both clinical needs and technical challenges in medical imaging, and describe how emerging trends in DL are addressing these issues. We cover the topics of network architecture, sparse and noisy labels, federating learning, interpretability, uncertainty quantification, and so on. Then, we present several case studies that are commonly found in clinical practice, including digital pathology and chest, brain, cardiovascular, and abdominal imaging.

Optical processors, which compute with photons instead of electrons, can fundamentally accelerate the development of artificial intelligence by offering substantially improved computing performance. There has been long-term interest in optically constructing the most widely used artificial-intelligence architecture, that is, artificial neural networks, to achieve brain-inspired information processing at the speed of light. However, owing to restrictions in design flexibility and the accumulation of system errors, existing processor architectures are not reconfigurable and have limited model complexity and experimental performance. Here, we propose the reconfigurable diffractive processing unit, an optoelectronic fused computing architecture based on the diffraction of light, which can support different neural networks and achieve a high model complexity with millions of neurons. Along with the developed adaptive training approach to circumvent system errors, we achieved excellent experimental accuracies for high-speed image and video recognition over benchmark datasets and a computing performance superior to that of cutting-edge electronic computing platforms. Linear diffractive structures are by themselves passive systems but researchers here exploit the non-linearity of a photodetector to realize a reconfigurable diffractive ‘processing’ unit.

Particularly, the nanocomposite papers show the maximum electrical conductivity of 3725.6 S·cm-1 and EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of ~80 dB at the MXene/AgNW content of 80 wt% with an absorption-dominant shielding mechanism owing to the massive ohmic losses in highly conductive MXene/AgNW layer, multiple internal reflections between Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets and polarization relaxation of localized defects and abundant terminal groups.

Objective Accurate diagnosis at an early stage is the need of the hour for initiation of therapy. The cause for most Alzheimer’s cases still remains unknown except where genetic distinctions have been observed. Thus, a standard drug regimen ensues in every Alzheimer’s patient, irrespective of the cause, which may not always be beneficial in halting or reversing the disease progression. To provide a better life to such patients by suppressing existing symptoms, early diagnosis, curative therapy, site-specific delivery of drugs, and application of hyphenated methods like artificial intelligence need to be brought into the main field of Alzheimer’s therapeutics.

The impact of Industry 4.0 technology adoption on sustainable manufacturing and circular economy has been under-researched. This paper aims to review the latest articles in the area of Industry 4.0, sustainable manufacturing and circular economy and further developed a research framework showing key paths.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nQualitative research is performed in two stages. In the first stage, a review of the extant literature is performed to identify the barriers, drivers, challenges and opportunities. In the second stage, a research framework is proposed to integrate Industry 4.0 technology (big data analytics powered artificial intelligence) adoption, sustainable manufacturing and circular economy capabilities.\n\n\nFindings\nThis research extends the knowledge base by providing a detailed review of Industry 4.0, sustainable manufacturing, and circular economy and proposes a research framework by integrating these three contemporary concepts in the context of supply chain management. Through an exploration of this integrative research framework, the authors propose a future research agenda and seven research propositions.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nIt is important to understand the interplay between institutional pressures, tangible resources and human skills for Industry 4.0 technology (big data analytics powered artificial intelligence) adoption. Industry 4.0 technology (big data analytics powered artificial intelligence) adoption can positively influence sustainable manufacturing and circular economy capabilities. Managers must also put more attention to sustainable manufacturing to develop circular economic capabilities.\n\n\nSocial implications\nFactory workers and the local communities generally suffer from various adverse effects resulting from the traditional manufacturing process. The quality of the environment is deteriorating to such an extent that people even staying miles away from the factory are also affected due to environmental pollution that is generated from factory operations. Hence, sustainable manufacturing is the only choice left to manufacturers that can help in the transition to a circular economy. The research framework can help firms to enhance circular economy capabilities.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis review paper contains the most updated work on Industry 4.0, sustainable manufacturing and circular economy. It also proposes a research framework to integrate these three concepts.\n"}, "authors": [{"id": "19267120", "name": "Surajit Bag"}, {"id": "119134870", "name": "J.

Neurosymbolic computing has been an active area of research for many years seeking to bring together robust learning in neural networks with reasoning and explainability by offering symbolic representations for neural models. In this paper, we relate recent and early research in neurosymbolic AI with the objective of identifying the most important ingredients of neurosymbolic AI systems.

This includes greater transparency about data, and accountability for decisions made when developing it. In this paper, we introduce a rigorous framework for dataset development transparency that supports decision-making and accountability. The framework uses the cyclical, infrastructural and engineering nature of dataset development to draw on best practices from the software development lifecycle. Each stage of the data development lifecycle yields documents that facilitate improved communication and decision-making, as well as drawing attention to the value and necessity of careful data work.

However, due to privacy concerns and the high cost of transmitting video data, it is highly challenging to build object detection models on centrally stored large training datasets following the current approach. Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to resolve this challenge. Nevertheless, there currently lacks an easy to use tool to enable computer vision application developers who are not experts in federated learning to conveniently leverage this technology and apply it in their systems. In this paper, we report FedVision - a machine learning engineering platform to support the development of federated learning powered computer vision applications. The platform has been deployed through a collaboration between WeBank and Extreme Vision to help customers develop computer vision-based safety monitoring solutions in smart city applications. Over four months of usage, it has achieved significant efficiency improvement and cost reduction while removing the need to transmit sensitive data for three major corporate customers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real application of FL in computer vision-based tasks."}, "authors": [{"id": "40457423", "name": "Yang Liu"}, {"id": "1382659939", "name": "Anbu Huang"}, {"id": "2118198952", "name": "Yu Luo"}, {"id": "2146258976", "name": "He Huang"}, {"id": "2108175824", "name": "Youzhi Liu"}, {"id": "2144037665", "name": "Yuanyuan Chen"}, {"id": "1488651529", "name": "Lican Feng"}, {"id": "11573257", "name": "Tianjian Chen"}, {"id": "1882223909", "name": "Hang Yu"}, {"id": "153096457", "name": "Qiang Yang"}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"]}

It encompasses the availability of open information on the health, treatment, complications, and recent progress on biomedical research. At present, even in low-income countries, diagnostic and medical services are becoming more accessible and available. However, many issues related to digital health technologies remain unmet, including the reliability, safety, testing, and ethical aspects. Purpose The aim of the review is to discuss and analyze the recent progress on the application of big data, artificial intelligence, telemedicine, block-chain platforms, smart devices in healthcare, and medical education. Basic Design. The publication search was carried out using Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Sciences, Medline, Wiley Online Library, and CrossRef databases. The review highlights the applications of artificial intelligence, “big data,” telemedicine and block-chain technologies, and smart devices (internet of things) for solving the real problems in healthcare and medical education. Major Findings. We identified 252 papers related to the digital health area. However, the number of papers discussed in the review was limited to 152 due to the exclusion criteria. The literature search demonstrated that digital health technologies became highly sought due to recent pandemics, including COVID-19. The disastrous dissemination of COVID-19 through all continents triggered the need for fast and effective solutions to localize, manage, and treat the viral infection. In this regard, the use of telemedicine and other e-health technologies might help to lessen the pressure on healthcare systems. Summary. Digital platforms can help optimize diagnosis, consulting, and treatment of patients. However, due to the lack of official regulations and recommendations, the stakeholders, including private and governmental organizations, are facing the problem with adequate validation and approbation of novel digital health technologies. In this regard, proper scientific research is required before a digital product is deployed for the healthcare sector."}, "authors": [{"id": "2037981398", "name": "Maksut Senbekov"}, {"id": "2089417216", "name": "T.

AI is a collection of computational methods for studying human knowledge, learning, and behavior, including by building agents able to know, learn, and behave. Ethics is a body of human knowledge—far from completely understood—that helps agents (humans today, but perhaps eventually robots and other AIs) decide how they and others should behave. Despite these differences, however, the rapid development in AI technology today has led to a growing number of ethical issues in a multitude of fields, ranging from disciplines as far-reaching as international human rights law to issues as intimate as personal identity and sexuality. In fact, the number and variety of topics in this volume illustrate the width, diversity of content, and at times exasperating vagueness of the boundaries of “AI Ethics” as a domain of inquiry. Within this discourse, the book points to the capacity of sociotechnical systems that utilize data-driven algorithms to classify, to make decisions, and to control complex systems. Given the wide-reaching and often intimate impact these AI systems have on daily human lives, this volume attempts to address the increasingly complicated relations between humanity and artificial intelligence. It considers not only how humanity must conduct themselves toward AI but also how AI must behave toward humanity."}, "authors": [], "fields_of_study": null}

After having been introduced to sales and marketing departments, artificial intelligence is also starting to guide employee-related decisions within HR management. The purpose is to support decisions that are based not on subjective aspects but on objective data analysis. The goal of this work is to analyse how objective factors influence employee attrition, in order to identify the main causes that contribute to a worker’s decision to leave a company, and to be able to predict whether a particular employee will leave the company. After the training, the obtained model for the prediction of employees’ attrition is tested on a real dataset provided by IBM analytics, which includes 35 features and about 1500 samples. Results are expressed in terms of classical metrics and the algorithm that produced the best results for the available dataset is the Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier.

However, the ways in which AI systems approach problems are often different from the ways people do, and thus may be uninterpretable and hard to learn from. A crucial step in bridging this gap between human and artificial intelligence is modeling the granular actions that constitute human behavior, rather than simply matching aggregate human performance. We pursue this goal in a model system with a long history in artificial intelligence: chess. The aggregate performance of a chess player unfolds as they make decisions over the course of a game. The hundreds of millions of games played online by players at every skill level form a rich source of data in which these decisions, and their exact context, are recorded in minute detail. Applying existing chess engines to this data, including an open-source implementation of AlphaZero, we find that they do not predict human moves well. We develop and introduce Maia, a customized version of AlphaZero trained on human chess games, that predicts human moves at a much higher accuracy than existing engines, and can achieve maximum accuracy when predicting decisions made by players at a specific skill level in a tuneable way. For a dual task of predicting whether a human will make a large mistake on the next move, we develop a deep neural network that significantly outperforms competitive baselines. Taken together, our results suggest that there is substantial promise in designing artificial intelligence systems with human collaboration in mind by first accurately modeling granular human decision-making."}, "authors": [{"id": "1412662592", "name": "Reid McIlroy-Young"}, {"id": "30721371", "name": "S.

More feasible plastic strategies (e.g., mechanoplasticity) are urgent to achieve comparable, versatile, and active cognitive complexity in neuromorphic systems. Here, a versatile mechanoplastic artificial synapse based on tribotronic floating‐gate MoS2 synaptic transistors is proposed. Mechanical displacement can induce triboelectric potential coupling to the floating‐gate synaptic transistor, trigger a postsynaptic current signal, and modulate the synaptic weights, which realizes the synaptic mechanoplasticity in an active and interactive way. Typical synaptic plasticity behaviors including potentiation/inhibition and paired pulse facilitation/depression are successfully imitated. Assistant with the charge trapping by floating gate, the artificial synapse can realize mechanical displacement derived short‐term and long‐term plasticity simultaneously. A facile artificial neural network is also constructed to demonstrate an adding synaptic weight and neuromorphic logic switching (AND, OR) by mechanoplasticity without building complex complementary metal oxide semiconductor circuits. The proposed mechanoplastic artificial synapse offers a favorable candidate for the construction of mechanical behavior derived neuromorphic devices to overcome the von Neumann bottleneck and perform advanced synaptic behaviors."}, "authors": [{"id": "48520615", "name": "Xixi Yang"}, {"id": "65851234", "name": "Jinran Yu"}, {"id": "1739359691", "name": "J.

Although chatbots can perform many tasks, the primary function they have to play is to understand the utterances of humans and to respond to them appropriately. In the past, simple statistic methods or handwritten templates and rules were used for the constructions of chatbot architectures. With the increasing learning capabilities, end-to-end neural networks have taken the place of these models in around 2015. Especially now, the encoder-decoder recurrent model is dominant in the modeling of conversations. This architecture is taken from the neural machine translation domain, and it performed very well there. Until now, plenty of features and variations are introduced that have remarkably enhanced the conversational capabilities of chatbots. In this paper, we performed a detailed survey on recent literature. We examined many publications from the last five years, which are related to chatbots.

Second, we draw upon an in-depth survey conducted in Dublin (1,233 respondents), to provide empirical evidence of (a) the public interest in autonomous cars and the intention to use them once available, (b) the fears and concerns that individuals have regarding autonomous vehicles and (c) how people intend to employ this new form of transport. Third, we use the empirics generated via the survey as a stepping stone to discuss possible urban futures, focusing on the changes in urban design and sustainability that the transition to autonomous transport is likely to trigger.

As one of the main ways of People's Daily communication, image is widely used as a carrier of communication because of its rich content, intuitive and other advantages. Image recognition based on convolution neural network is the first application in the field of image recognition. A series of algorithm operations such as image eigenvalue extraction, recognition and convolution are used to identify and analyze different images. The rapid development of artificial intelligence makes machine learning more and more important in its research field. Use algorithms to learn each piece of data and predict the outcome. This has become an important key to open the door of artificial intelligence. In machine vision, image recognition is the foundation, but how to associate the low-level information in the image with the high-level image semantics becomes the key problem of image recognition. Predecessors have provided many model algorithms, which have laid a solid foundation for the development of artificial intelligence and image recognition. The multi-level information fusion model based on the VGG16 model is an improvement on the fully connected neural network. Different from full connection network, convolutional neural network does not use full connection method in each layer of neurons of neural network, but USES some nodes for connection. Although this method reduces the computation time, due to the fact that the convolutional neural network model will lose some useful feature information in the process of propagation and calculation, this paper improves the model to be a multi-level information fusion of the convolution calculation method, and further recovers the discarded feature information, so as to improve the recognition rate of the image. VGG divides the network into five groups (mimicking the five layers of AlexNet), yet it USES 3∗3 filters and combines them as a convolution sequence. Network deeper DCNN, channel number is bigger. The recognition rate of the model was verified by 0RL Face Database, BioID Face Database and CASIA Face Image Database."}, "authors": [{"id": "1557603653", "name": "Guangxin Lou"}, {"id": "1557387667", "name": "Hongzhen Shi"}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science"]}

Two sets of conceptual questions are prominent in theoretical engagements with artificial neural networks, especially in the context of medical artificial intelligence: (1) Are networks explainable, and if so, what does it mean to explain the output of a network? And (2) what does it mean for a network to be interpretable? We argue that accounts of “explanation” tailored specifically to neural networks have ineffectively reinvented the wheel. In response to (1), we show how four familiar accounts of explanation apply to neural networks as they would to any scientific phenomenon. We diagnose the confusion about explaining neural networks within the machine learning literature as an equivocation on “explainability,” “understandability” and “interpretability.” To remedy this, we distinguish between these notions, and answer (2) by offering a theory and typology of interpretation in machine learning. Interpretation is something one does to an explanation with the aim of producing another, more understandable, explanation. As with explanation, there are various concepts and methods involved in interpretation: Total or Partial, Global or Local, and Approximative or Isomorphic. Our account of “interpretability” is consistent with uses in the machine learning literature, in keeping with the philosophy of explanation and understanding, and pays special attention to medical artificial intelligence systems."}, "authors": [{"id": "72178646", "name": "A.

We take language to be a part of a system for understanding and communicating about situations.

Current artificial language processing systems rely on the same domain general principles, embodied in artificial neural networks. Indeed, recent progress in this field depends on query-based attention, which extends the ability of these systems to exploit context and has contributed to remarkable breakthroughs. Nevertheless, most current models focus exclusively on language-internal tasks, limiting their ability to perform tasks that depend on understanding situations. These systems also lack memory for the contents of prior situations outside of a fixed contextual span. We describe the organization of the brain’s distributed understanding system, which includes a fast learning system that addresses the memory problem.

Manual screening using fundus photographs has however involved considerable costs for patients, clinicians and national health systems, which has limited its application particularly in less-developed countries. The advent of artificial intelligence, and in particular deep learning techniques, has however raised the possibility of widespread automated screening. Main text In this review, we first briefly survey major published advances in retinal analysis using artificial intelligence. We take care to separately describe standard multiple-field fundus photography, and the newer modalities of ultra-wide field photography and smartphone-based photography. Finally, we consider several machine learning concepts that have been particularly relevant to the domain and illustrate their usage with extant works. Conclusions In the ophthalmology field, it was demonstrated that deep learning tools for diabetic retinopathy show clinically acceptable diagnostic performance when using colour retinal fundus images. Artificial intelligence models are among the most promising solutions to tackle the burden of diabetic retinopathy management in a comprehensive manner. However, future research is crucial to assess the potential clinical deployment, evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different DL systems in clinical practice and improve clinical acceptance."}, "authors": [{"id": "40062372", "name": "Gilbert Lim"}, {"id": "119586308", "name": "V.

It is an urgent challenge to integrate the advanced machine learning technology and large amount of real-time data from wide area measurement systems and intelligent electronic devices, in order to effectively enhance power system resilience and ensure the reliable and secure operation of power systems. Therefore, this paper aims to systematically review the existing application of machine learning methods on power system resilience enhancement, to expand the interest of researchers and scholars in this topic, and to jointly promote the application of artificial intelligence in the field of power systems."}, "authors": [{"id": "97766930", "name": "Jian Xie"}, {"id": "1415025957", "name": "I.

In this chapter, we leverage our survey of explanation literature in Artificial Intelligence and closely related fields and use these past efforts to generate a set of explanation types that we feel reflect the expanded needs of explanation for today's artificial intelligence applications.

New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2021. 336 pages. Hardcover; $28.00. ISBN: 9780300209570. *Atlas of AI: Power, Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence is Kate Crawford's analysis of the state of the AI industry. A central idea of her book is the importance of redefining Artificial Intelligence (AI). She states, \"I've argued that there is much at stake in how we define AI, what its boundaries are, and who determines them: it shapes what can be seen and contested\" (p. 217). *My own definition of AI goes something like this: I¬†imagine a future where I'm sitting in a cafe drinking coffee with my friends, but in this future, one of my friends is a robot, who like me is trying to make a living in this world. A future where humans and robots live in harmony. Crawford views this definition as mythological: \"These mythologies are particularly strong in the field of artificial intelligence, where the belief that human intelligence can be formalized and reproduced by machines has been axiomatic since the mid-twentieth century\" (p.¬†5). I do not know if my definition of artificial intelligence can come true, but I am enjoying the process of building, experimenting, and dreaming. *In her book, she asks me to consider that I may be unknowingly participating, as she states, in \"a material product of colonialism, with its patterns of extraction, conflict, and environmental destruction\" (p. 38). The book's subtitle illuminates the purpose of the book: specifically, the power, politics, and planetary costs of usurping artificial intelligence. Of course, this is not exactly Crawford's subtitle, and this is where I both agree and disagree with her. The book's subtitle is actually Power, Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence. In my opinion, AI is more the canary in the coal mine. We can use the canary to detect the poisonous gases, but we cannot blame the canary for the poisonous gas. It risks missing the point. Is AI itself to be feared? Should we no longer teach or learn AI? Or is this more about how we discern responsible use and direction for AI technology? *There is another author who speaks to similar issues. In Weapons of Math Destruction, Cathy O'Neil states it this way, \"If we had been clear-headed, we all would have taken a step back at this point to figure out how math had been misused ... But instead ... new mathematical techniques were hotter than ever ... A computer program could speed through thousands of resumes or loan applications in a second or two and sort them into neat lists, with the most promising candidates on top\" (p. 13). *Both Crawford and O'Neil point to human flaws that often lead to well-intentioned software developers creating code that results in unfair and discriminatory decisions. AI models encode unintended human biases that may not evaluate candidates as fairly as we would expect, yet there is a widespread notion that we can trust the algorithm. For example, the last time you registered an account on a website, did you click the checkbox confirming that \"yes, I read the disclaimer\" even though you did not? When we click \"yes\" we are accepting this disclaimer and placing trust in the software. Business owners place trust in software when they use it to make predictions. Engineers place trust in their algorithms when they write software without rigorous testing protocols. I¬†am just as guilty. *Crawford suggests that AI is often used in ways that are harmful. In the Atlas of AI we are given a tour of how technology is damaging our world: strip mining, labor injustice, the misuse of personal data, issues of state and power, to name a few of the concerns Crawford raises. The reality is that AI is built upon existing infrastructure. For example, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Amazon, TikTok have been collecting our information for profit even before AI became important to them. The data centers, CPU houses, and worldwide network infrastructure were already in place to meet consumer demand and geopolitics. But it is true that AI brings new technologies to the table, such as automated face recognition and decision tools to compare prospective employment applicants with diverse databases and employee monitoring tools that can make automatic recommendations. Governments, militaries, and intelligence agencies have taken notice. As invasion of privacy and social justice concerns emerge, Crawford calls us to consider these issues carefully. *Reading Crawford's words pricked my conscience, convicting me to reconsider my erroneous ways. For big tech to exist, to supply what we demand, it needs resources. She walks us through the many resources the technology industry needs to provide what we want, and AI is the \"new kid on the block.\" This book is not about AI, per se; it is instead about the side effects of poor business/research practices, opportunist behavior, power politics, and how these behaviors not only exploit our planet but also unjustly affect marginalized people. The AI industry is simply a new example of this reality: data mining, low wages to lower costs, foreign workers with fewer rights, strip mining, relying on coal and oil for electricity (although some tech companies have made strides to improve sustainability). This sounds more like a parable about the sins of the tech industry than a critique about the dangers of AI. *Could the machine learning community, like the inventors of dynamite who wanted to simply help railroads excavate tunnels, be unintentionally causing harm? Should we, as a community, be on the lookout for these potential harms? Do we have a moral responsibility? Maybe the technology sector needs to look more inwardly to ensure that process efficiency and cost savings are not elevated as most important. *I did not agree with everything that Crawford classified as AI, but I do agree that as a community we are responsible for our actions.

Applications of AI transform the tools of education. AI has a variety of educational applications, such as personalized learning platforms to promote students’ learning, automated assessment systems to aid teachers, and facial recognition systems to generate insights about learners’ behaviors. Despite the potential benefits of AI to support students’ learning experiences and teachers’ practices, the ethical and societal drawbacks of these systems are rarely fully considered in K-12 educational contexts. The ethical challenges of AI in education must be identified and introduced to teachers and students. To address these issues, this paper (1) briefly defines AI through the concepts of machine learning and algorithms; (2) introduces applications of AI in educational settings and benefits of AI systems to support students’ learning processes; (3) describes ethical challenges and dilemmas of using AI in education; and (4) addresses the teaching and understanding of AI by providing recommended instructional resources from two providers—i.e., the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) Media Lab and Code.org. The article aims to help practitioners reap the benefits and navigate ethical challenges of integrating AI in K-12 classrooms, while also introducing instructional resources that teachers can use to advance K-12 students’ understanding of AI and ethics."}, "authors": [{"id": "1391112109", "name": "Selin Akgun"}, {"id": "1736838", "name": "Christine Greenhow"}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"]}

Besides, the context of digitalization, integration, and globalization of the supply chain has raised an increasing awareness of advanced information processing techniques such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) in building SCRes and improving supply chain performance (SCP). The present study investigates the direct and indirect effects of AI, SCRes, and SCP under a context of dynamism and uncertainty of the supply chain. In doing so, we have conceptualized the use of AI in the supply chain on the organizational information processing theory (OIPT). The developed framework was evaluated using a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. Survey data was collected from 279 firms representing different sizes, operating in various sectors, and countries. Our findings suggest that while AI has a direct impact on SCP in the short-term, it is recommended to exploit its information processing capabilities to build SCRes for long-lasting SCP. This study is among the first to provide empirical evidence on maximizing the benefits of AI capabilities to generate sustained SCP.

Simple visual inspections of the NSD data reveal clear representational transformations along the ventral visual pathway. Further exemplifying the inferential power of the dataset, we used NSD to build and train deep neural network models that predict brain activity more accurately than state-of-the-art models from computer vision. NSD also includes substantial resting-state and diffusion data, enabling network neuroscience perspectives to constrain and enhance models of perception and memory. Given its unprecedented scale, quality and breadth, NSD opens new avenues of inquiry in cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

However, low efficacy, off-target delivery, time consumption, and high cost impose a hurdle and challenges that impact drug design and discovery. Further, complex and big data from genomics, proteomics, microarray data, and clinical trials also impose an obstacle in the drug discovery pipeline. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technology play a crucial role in drug discovery and development. In other words, artificial neural networks and deep learning algorithms have modernized the area. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been implemented in several drug discovery processes such as peptide synthesis, structure-based virtual screening, ligand-based virtual screening, toxicity prediction, drug monitoring and release, pharmacophore modeling, quantitative structure–activity relationship, drug repositioning, polypharmacology, and physiochemical activity. Evidence from the past strengthens the implementation of artificial intelligence and deep learning in this field. Moreover, novel data mining, curation, and management techniques provided critical support to recently developed modeling algorithms. In summary, artificial intelligence and deep learning advancements provide an excellent opportunity for rational drug design and discovery process, which will eventually impact mankind. The primary concern associated with drug design and development is time consumption and production cost. Further, inefficiency, inaccurate target delivery, and inappropriate dosage are other hurdles that inhibit the process of drug delivery and development. With advancements in technology, computer-aided drug design integrating artificial intelligence algorithms can eliminate the challenges and hurdles of traditional drug design and development. Artificial intelligence is referred to as superset comprising machine learning, whereas machine learning comprises supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Further, deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has been extensively implemented in drug design and development. The artificial neural network, deep neural network, support vector machines, classification and regression, generative adversarial networks, symbolic learning, and meta-learning are examples of the algorithms applied to the drug design and discovery process. Artificial intelligence has been applied to different areas of drug design and development process, such as from peptide synthesis to molecule design, virtual screening to molecular docking, quantitative structure–activity relationship to drug repositioning, protein misfolding to protein–protein interactions, and molecular pathway identification to polypharmacology. Artificial intelligence principles have been applied to the classification of active and inactive, monitoring drug release, pre-clinical and clinical development, primary and secondary drug screening, biomarker development, pharmaceutical manufacturing, bioactivity identification and physiochemical properties, prediction of toxicity, and identification of mode of action."}, "authors": [{"id": "1409846740", "name": "Rohan Gupta"}, {"id": "153610437", "name": "Devesh Srivastava"}, {"id": "2059118408", "name": "Mehar Sahu"}, {"id": "2072850683", "name": "Swati Tiwari"}, {"id": "2288195", "name": "R.

Although the ECG has long offered valuable insights into cardiac and non-cardiac health and disease, its interpretation requires considerable human expertise. Advanced AI methods, such as deep-learning convolutional neural networks, have enabled rapid, human-like interpretation of the ECG, while signals and patterns largely unrecognizable to human interpreters can be detected by multilayer AI networks with precision, making the ECG a powerful, non-invasive biomarker. Large sets of digital ECGs linked to rich clinical data have been used to develop AI models for the detection of left ventricular dysfunction, silent (previously undocumented and asymptomatic) atrial fibrillation and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as well as the determination of a person’s age, sex and race, among other phenotypes. The clinical and population-level implications of AI-based ECG phenotyping continue to emerge, particularly with the rapid rise in the availability of mobile and wearable ECG technologies. In this Review, we summarize the current and future state of the AI-enhanced ECG in the detection of cardiovascular disease in at-risk populations, discuss its implications for clinical decision-making in patients with cardiovascular disease and critically appraise potential limitations and unknowns. In this Review, Friedman and colleagues summarize the use of artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiography in the detection of cardiovascular disease in at-risk populations, discuss its implications for clinical decision-making in patients with cardiovascular disease and critically appraise potential limitations and unknowns. The feasibility and potential value of the application of advanced artificial intelligence methods, particularly deep-learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to the electrocardiogram (ECG) have been demonstrated. CNNs developed with the use of large numbers of digital ECGs linked to rich clinical datasets might be able to perform accurate and nuanced, human-like interpretation of ECGs. CNNs have also been developed to detect asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, silent atrial fibrillation, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and an individual’s age, sex and race on the basis of the ECG alone. CNNs to detect other cardiac conditions, such as aortic valve stenosis and amyloid heart disease, are in active development. These approaches might be applicable to the standard 12-lead ECG or to data obtained from single-lead or multilead mobile or wearable ECG technologies.

Few previous studies have investigated this topic from a multi-disciplinary perspective, including accounting, business and management, decision sciences and health professions. Methods The structured literature review with its reliable and replicable research protocol allowed the researchers to extract 288 peer-reviewed papers from Scopus. The authors used qualitative and quantitative variables to analyse authors, journals, keywords, and collaboration networks among researchers. Additionally, the paper benefited from the Bibliometrix R software package. Results The investigation showed that the literature in this field is emerging. It focuses on health services management, predictive medicine, patient data and diagnostics, and clinical decision-making. The United States, China, and the United Kingdom contributed the highest number of studies. Keyword analysis revealed that AI can support physicians in making a diagnosis, predicting the spread of diseases and customising treatment paths. Conclusions The literature reveals several AI applications for health services and a stream of research that has not fully been covered. For instance, AI projects require skills and data quality awareness for data-intensive analysis and knowledge-based management.

However, there is growing concern that such AI systems may reflect and amplify human bias, and reduce the quality of their performance in historically under-served populations such as female patients, Black patients, or patients of low socioeconomic status. Such biases are especially troubling in the context of underdiagnosis, whereby the AI algorithm would inaccurately label an individual with a disease as healthy, potentially delaying access to care. Here, we examine algorithmic underdiagnosis in chest X-ray pathology classification across three large chest X-ray datasets, as well as one multi-source dataset. We find that classifiers produced using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques consistently and selectively underdiagnosed under-served patient populations and that the underdiagnosis rate was higher for intersectional under-served subpopulations, for example, Hispanic female patients. Deployment of AI systems using medical imaging for disease diagnosis with such biases risks exacerbation of existing care biases and can potentially lead to unequal access to medical treatment, thereby raising ethical concerns for the use of these models in the clinic.

However, while the opportunities for AI are promising, the impact of AI systems on the culture of, norms in, and expectations about interactions between students and instructors are still elusive. In online learning, learner–instructor interaction (inter alia, communication, support, and presence) has a profound impact on students’ satisfaction and learning outcomes. Thus, identifying how students and instructors perceive the impact of AI systems on their interaction is important to identify any gaps, challenges, or barriers preventing AI systems from achieving their intended potential and risking the safety of these interactions. To address this need for forward-looking decisions, we used Speed Dating with storyboards to analyze the authentic voices of 12 students and 11 instructors on diverse use cases of possible AI systems in online learning. Findings show that participants envision adopting AI systems in online learning can enable personalized learner–instructor interaction at scale but at the risk of violating social boundaries. Although AI systems have been positively recognized for improving the quantity and quality of communication, for providing just-in-time, personalized support for large-scale settings, and for improving the feeling of connection, there were concerns about responsibility, agency, and surveillance issues. These findings have implications for the design of AI systems to ensure explainability, human-in-the-loop, and careful data collection and presentation. Overall, contributions of this study include the design of AI system storyboards which are technically feasible and positively support learner–instructor interaction, capturing students’ and instructors’ concerns of AI systems through Speed Dating, and suggesting practical implications for maximizing the positive impact of AI systems while minimizing the negative ones."}, "authors": [{"id": "152359899", "name": "Kyoungwon Seo"}, {"id": "2148904085", "name": "Joice Tang"}, {"id": "3130238", "name": "Ido Roll"}, {"id": "145432756", "name": "Sidney S.

Many AI technologies end up owned and controlled by private entities. The nature of the implementation of AI could mean such corporations, clinics and public bodies will have a greater than typical role in obtaining, utilizing and protecting patient health information. This raises privacy issues relating to implementation and data security. The first set of concerns includes access, use and control of patient data in private hands. Some recent public–private partnerships for implementing AI have resulted in poor protection of privacy. As such, there have been calls for greater systemic oversight of big data health research. Appropriate safeguards must be in place to maintain privacy and patient agency. Private custodians of data can be impacted by competing goals and should be structurally encouraged to ensure data protection and to deter alternative use thereof. Another set of concerns relates to the external risk of privacy breaches through AI-driven methods. The ability to deidentify or anonymize patient health data may be compromised or even nullified in light of new algorithms that have successfully reidentified such data. This could increase the risk to patient data under private custodianship. We are currently in a familiar situation in which regulation and oversight risk falling behind the technologies they govern. Regulation should emphasize patient agency and consent, and should encourage increasingly sophisticated methods of data anonymization and protection."}, "authors": [{"id": "34708456", "name": "Blake Murdoch"}], "fields_of_study": ["Medicine"]}

As a result, education platforms and applications are more closely aligned with learners’ needs and knowledge, making the educational process more efficient. Therefore, AI and ML have great potential in e-learning and higher education institutions (HEI). Thus, the article aims to determine its potential and use areas in higher education based on secondary research and document analysis (literature review), content analysis, and primary research (survey). As referent points for this research, multiple academic, scientific, and commercial sources were used to obtain a broader picture of the research subject. Furthermore, the survey was implemented among students in the Republic of Serbia, with 103 respondents to generate data and information on how much knowledge of AI and ML is held by the student population, mainly to understand both opportunities and challenges involved in AI and ML in HEI. The study addresses critical issues, like common knowledge and stance of research bases regarding AI and ML in HEI; best practices regarding usage of AI and ML in HEI; students’ knowledge of AI and ML; and students’ attitudes regarding AI and ML opportunities and challenges in HEI. In statistical considerations, aiming to evaluate if the indicators were considered reflexive and, in this case, belong to the same theoretical dimension, the Correlation Matrix was presented, followed by the Composite Reliability.

Addressing this challenge, ML models trained from large material datasets that relate structure, properties and function at multiple hierarchical levels have offered new avenues for fast exploration of the design spaces.

Methods and analysis TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI will be developed following published guidance from the EQUATOR Network, and will comprise five stages. Stage 1 will comprise two systematic reviews (across all medical fields and specifically in oncology) to examine the quality of reporting in published machine-learning-based prediction model studies. In stage 2, we will consult a diverse group of key stakeholders using a Delphi process to identify items to be considered for inclusion in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 3 will be virtual consensus meetings to consolidate and prioritise key items to be included in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 4 will involve developing the TRIPOD-AI checklist and the PROBAST-AI tool, and writing the accompanying explanation and elaboration papers. In the final stage, stage 5, we will disseminate TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI via journals, conferences, blogs, websites (including TRIPOD, PROBAST and EQUATOR Network) and social media. TRIPOD-AI will provide researchers working on prediction model studies based on machine learning with a reporting guideline that can help them report key details that readers need to evaluate the study quality and interpret its findings, potentially reducing research waste.

Clinicians may also serve as administrators in governing the use of clinical AI. A natural question follows: are clinicians adequately prepared to identify circumstances in which AI systems fail to perform their intended function reliably? A major driver of AI system malfunction is known as “dataset shift.”4,5 Most clinical AI systems today use machine learning, algorithms that leverage statistical methods to learn key patterns from clinical data. Dataset shift occurs when a machine-learning system underperforms because of a mismatch between the data set with which it was developed and the data on which it is deployed.4 For example, the University of Michigan Hospital implemented the widely used sepsis-alerting model developed by Epic Systems; in April 2020, the model had to be deactivated because of spurious alerting owing to changes in patients’ demographic characteristics associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. This was a case in which dataset shift fundamentally altered the relationship between fevers and bacterial sepsis, leading the hospital’s clinical AI governing committee (which one of the authors of this letter chairs) to decommission its use. This is an extreme example; many causes of dataset shift are more subtle. In Table 1, we present common causes of dataset shift, which we group into changes in technology (e.g., software vendors), changes in population and setting (e.g., new demographics), and changes in behavior (e.g., new reimbursement incentives); the list is not meant to be exhaustive. Successful recognition and mitigation of dataset shift require both vigilant clinicians and sound technical oversight through AI governance teams.4,5 When using an AI system, clinicians should note misalignment between the predictions of the model and their own clinical judgment, as in the sepsis example above. Clinicians who use AI systems must frequently consider whether relevant aspects of their own clinical practice are atypical or have recently changed. For their part, AI governance teams must be sure that it is easy for clinicians to report concerns about the function of AI systems and provide feedback so that the clinician who is reporting will understand that the registered concern has been noted and, if appropriate, actions to mitigate the concern have been taken. Teams must also establish AI monitoring and updating protocols that integrate technical solu-"}, "authors": [{"id": "50478054", "name": "S. G.

Discussions on many relevant topics, such as trustworthiness, explainability, and ethics are characterized by implicit anthropocentric and anthropomorphistic conceptions and, for instance, the pursuit of human-like intelligence as the golden standard for Artificial Intelligence. In order to provide more agreement and to substantiate possible future research objectives, this paper presents three notions on the similarities and differences between human- and artificial intelligence: 1) the fundamental constraints of human (and artificial) intelligence, 2) human intelligence as one of many possible forms of general intelligence, and 3) the high potential impact of multiple (integrated) forms of narrow-hybrid AI applications. For the time being, AI systems will have fundamentally different cognitive qualities and abilities than biological systems. For this reason, a most prominent issue is how we can use (and “collaborate” with) these systems as effectively as possible? For what tasks and under what conditions, decisions are safe to leave to AI and when is human judgment required? How can we capitalize on the specific strengths of human- and artificial intelligence? How to deploy AI systems effectively to complement and compensate for the inherent constraints of human cognition (and vice versa)? Should we pursue the development of AI “partners” with human (-level) intelligence or should we focus more at supplementing human limitations? In order to answer these questions, humans working with AI systems in the workplace or in policy making have to develop an adequate mental model of the underlying ‘psychological’ mechanisms of AI.

Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, has been proven particularly applicable in health care, with the ability for complex dialog management and conversational flexibility. Objective This review article aims to report on the recent advances and current trends in chatbot technology in medicine. A brief historical overview, along with the developmental progress and design characteristics, is first introduced. The focus will be on cancer therapy, with in-depth discussions and examples of diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, patient support, workflow efficiency, and health promotion. In addition, this paper will explore the limitations and areas of concern, highlighting ethical, moral, security, technical, and regulatory standards and evaluation issues to explain the hesitancy in implementation. Methods A search of the literature published in the past 20 years was conducted using the IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and OVID databases. The screening of chatbots was guided by the open-access Botlist directory for health care components and further divided according to the following criteria: diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, support, workflow, and health promotion. Results Even after addressing these issues and establishing the safety or efficacy of chatbots, human elements in health care will not be replaceable. Therefore, chatbots have the potential to be integrated into clinical practice by working alongside health practitioners to reduce costs, refine workflow efficiencies, and improve patient outcomes. Other applications in pandemic support, global health, and education are yet to be fully explored. Conclusions Further research and interdisciplinary collaboration could advance this technology to dramatically improve the quality of care for patients, rebalance the workload for clinicians, and revolutionize the practice of medicine."}, "authors": [{"id": "70986845", "name": "Lu Xu"}, {"id": "49076259", "name": "Leslie Sanders"}, {"id": "2158259399", "name": "Kay Li"}, {"id": "2070775504", "name": "J.

While there is considerable literature emerging on various aspects of AI, governance of AI is a significantly underdeveloped area. The new applications of AI offer opportunities for increasing economic efficiency and quality of life, but they also generate unexpected and unintended consequences and pose new forms of risks that need to be addressed. To enhance the benefits from AI while minimising the adverse risks, governments worldwide need to understand better the scope and depth of the risks posed and develop regulatory and governance processes and structures to address these challenges. This introductory article unpacks AI and describes why the Governance of AI should be gaining far more attention given the myriad of challenges it presents. It then summarises the special issue articles and highlights their key contributions. This special issue introduces the multifaceted challenges of governance of AI, including emerging governance approaches to AI, policy capacity building, exploring legal and regulatory challenges of AI and Robotics, and outstanding issues and gaps that need attention. The special issue showcases the state-of-the-art in the governance of AI, aiming to enable researchers and practitioners to appreciate the challenges and complexities of AI governance and highlight future avenues for exploration."}, "authors": [{"id": "3299973", "name": "Araz Taeihagh"}], "fields_of_study": null}

We identify two crucial opportunities that AI offers in this domain: it can help improve and expand current understanding of climate change, and it can contribute to combatting the climate crisis effectively. However, the development of AI also raises two sets of problems when considering climate change: the possible exacerbation of social and ethical challenges already associated with AI, and the contribution to climate change of the greenhouse gases emitted by training data and computation-intensive AI systems. We assess the carbon footprint of AI research, and the factors that influence AI’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in this domain. We find that the carbon footprint of AI research may be significant and highlight the need for more evidence concerning the trade-off between the GHG emissions generated by AI research and the energy and resource efficiency gains that AI can offer. In light of our analysis, we argue that leveraging the opportunities offered by AI for global climate change whilst limiting its risks is a gambit which requires responsive, evidence-based, and effective governance to become a winning strategy. We conclude by identifying the European Union as being especially well-placed to play a leading role in this policy response and provide 13 recommendations that are designed to identify and harness the opportunities of AI for combatting climate change, while reducing its impact on the environment."}, "authors": [{"id": "3011486", "name": "Josh Cowls"}, {"id": "2005338318", "name": "Andreas Tsamados"}, {"id": "2084659", "name": "M.

However, this application of AI has provoked much debate. On the one hand, powerful AI data analytics increase the quality of feedback, which may enhance employee productivity (“deployment effect”). On the other hand, employees may develop a negative perception of AI feedback once it is disclosed to them, thus harming their productivity (“disclosure effect”). We examine these two effects theoretically and test them empirically using data from a field experiment. We find strong evidence that both effects coexist, and that the adverse disclosure effect is mitigated by employees' tenure in the firm. These findings offer pivotal implications for management theory, practice, and public policies. Managerial abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are bound to transform how companies manage employees. We examine the use of AI to generate performance feedback for employees. We demonstrate that AI significantly increases the accuracy and consistency of the analyses of information collected, and the relevance of feedback to each employee. These advantages of AI help employees achieve greater job performance at scale, and thus create value for companies. However, our study also alerts companies to the negative effect of disclosing using AI to employee that results from employees' negative perceptions about the deployment of AI, which offsets the business value created by AI. To alleviate value‐destroying disclosure effect, we suggest that companies be more proactive in communicating with their employees about the objectives, benefits, and scope of AI applications in order to assuage their concerns. Moreover, the result of the allayed negative AI disclosure effect among employees with a longer tenure in the company suggests that companies may consider deploying AI in a tiered instead of a uniform fashion, that is, using AI to provide performance feedback to veteran employees but using human managers to provide performance feedback to novices."}, "authors": [{"id": "120794318", "name": "Siliang Tong"}, {"id": "47239765", "name": "Nan Jia"}, {"id": "40581742", "name": "Xueming Luo"}, {"id": "1739734836", "name": "Z.

Industries are focusing on improving product consistency, productivity and reducing operating costs, and they want to achieve this with the collaborative partnership between robotics and people. In smart industries, hyperconnected manufacturing processes depend on different machines that interact using AI automation systems by capturing and interpreting all data types. Smart platforms of automation can play a decisive role in transforming modern production. AI provides appropriate information to take decision-making and alert people of possible malfunctions. Industries will use AI to process data transmitted from the Internet of things (IoT) devices and connected machines based on their desire to integrate them into their equipment. It provides companies with the ability to track their entire end-to-end activities and processes fully. This literature review-based paper aims to brief the vital role of AI in successfully implementing Industry 4.0. Accordingly, the research objectives are crafted to facilitate researchers, practitioners, students and industry professionals in this paper. First, it discusses the significant technological features and traits of AI, critical for Industry 4.0. Second, this paper identifies the significant advancements and various challenges enabling the implementation of AI for Industry 4.0. Finally, the paper identifies and discusses significant applications of AI for Industry 4.0. With an extensive review-based exploration, we see that the advantages of AI are widespread and the need for stakeholders in understanding the kind of automation platform they require in the new manufacturing order. Furthermore, this technology seeks correlations to avoid errors and eventually to anticipate them. Thus, AI technology is gradually accomplishing various goals of Industry 4.0."}, "authors": [{"id": "49884103", "name": "M.

Purpose To establish and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI) system for differentiating COVID-19 and other pneumonia at chest CT and assessing radiologist performance without and with AI assistance. Materials and Methods A total of 521 patients with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results for COVID-19 and abnormal chest CT findings were retrospectively identified from 10 hospitals from January 2020 to April 2020. A total of 665 patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia and definite evidence of pneumonia at chest CT were retrospectively selected from three hospitals between 2017 and 2019. To classify COVID-19 versus other pneumonia for each patient, abnormal CT slices were input into the EfficientNet B4 deep neural network architecture after lung segmentation, followed by a two-layer fully connected neural network to pool slices together. The final cohort of 1186 patients (132 583 CT slices) was divided into training, validation, and test sets in a 7:2:1 and equal ratio. Independent testing was performed by evaluating model performance in separate hospitals. Studies were blindly reviewed by six radiologists without and then with AI assistance. Results The final model achieved a test accuracy of 96% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90%, 98%), a sensitivity of 95% (95% CI: 83%, 100%), and a specificity of 96% (95% CI: 88%, 99%) with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.90. On independent testing, this model achieved an accuracy of 87% (95% CI: 82%, 90%), a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI: 81%, 94%), and a specificity of 86% (95% CI: 80%, 90%) with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.90 and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.87. Assisted by the probabilities of the model, the radiologists achieved a higher average test accuracy (90% vs 85%, &#916; = 5, P < .001), sensitivity (88% vs 79%, &#916; = 9, P < .001), and specificity (91% vs 88%, &#916; = 3, P = .001).

Building on literature in moral and legal philosophy, and ethics of technology, the paper proposes a broader and more comprehensive analysis of the responsibility gap. The responsibility gap, it is argued, is not one problem but a set of at least four interconnected problems – gaps in culpability, moral and public accountability, active responsibility—caused by different sources, some technical, other organisational, legal, ethical, and societal. Responsibility gaps may also happen with non-learning systems. The paper clarifies which aspect of AI may cause which gap in which form of responsibility, and why each of these gaps matter. It proposes a critical review of partial and non-satisfactory attempts to address the responsibility gap: those which present it as a new and intractable problem (“fatalism”), those which dismiss it as a false problem (“deflationism”), and those which reduce it to only one of its dimensions or sources and/or present it as a problem that can be solved by simply introducing new technical and/or legal tools (“solutionism”). The paper also outlines a more comprehensive approach to address the responsibility gaps with AI in their entirety, based on the idea of designing socio-technical systems for “meaningful human control\", that is systems aligned with the relevant human reasons and capacities."}, "authors": [{"id": "13116364", "name": "Filippo Santoni de Sio"}, {"id": "31122515", "name": "G.

Public data sets were cited more often than private data sets, suggesting that public data sets contribute more to new development and benchmarks.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nThis scoping review identified 3 issues in data sets that are used to develop and test clinical AI algorithms for skin disease that should be addressed before clinical translation: (1) sparsity of data set characterization and lack of transparency, (2) nonstandard and unverified disease labels, and (3) inability to fully assess patient diversity used for algorithm development and testing."}, "authors": [{"id": "2274441233", "name": "R.

Failure to detect those may result in wrong diagnoses and medical errors. Compared with rule-based systems, however, these systems are less transparent and their errors less predictable. Thus, it is difficult, yet critical, for physicians to carefully evaluate AI advice. This study uncovers the cognitive challenges that medical decision makers face when they receive potentially incorrect advice from AI-based diagnosis systems and must decide whether to follow or reject it. In experiments with 68 novice and 12 experienced physicians, novice physicians with and without clinical experience as well as experienced radiologists made more inaccurate diagnosis decisions when provided with incorrect AI advice than without advice at all. We elicit five decision-making patterns and show that wrong diagnostic decisions often result from shortcomings in utilizing metacognitions related to decision makers’ own reasoning (self-monitoring) and metacognitions related to the AI-based system (system monitoring). As a result, physicians fall for decisions based on beliefs rather than actual data or engage in unsuitably superficial evaluation of the AI advice. Our study has implications for the training of physicians and spotlights the crucial role of human actors in compensating for AI errors."}, "authors": [{"id": "52140313", "name": "Ekaterina Jussupow"}, {"id": "1867744", "name": "Kai Spohrer"}, {"id": "1719645", "name": "Armin Heinzl"}, {"id": "32725507", "name": "J.

Based on the well-recognized Technology-based Learning Review model, several dimensions, such as research methods, research sample groups, adopted technology, language skills, the role of AI in language education, and learning outcomes, were taken into account. The review results show that the main application domains of AILEd research were writing, reading, and vocabulary acquisition. In terms of applied technology and algorithms, AI in language education mostly adopted ITS (Intelligent Tutoring System) and NLP (Natural Language Processing). Besides, several commonly used AI algorithms were Statistical Learning, Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Parsing. It was also found that some research focused on learning anxiety, willingness to communicate, knowledge acquisition, and classroom interaction. However, higher order thinking, complex problem solving, critical thinking ability, and collaborative learning tendencies were rarely considered in AILEd studies. Accordingly, several suggestions are provided to researchers, teachers, and decision makers for applying or studying AI applications in language education in the future."}, "authors": [{"id": "2118675513", "name": "Jiaen Liang"}, {"id": "144217709", "name": "Gwo-jen Hwang"}, {"id": "145138762", "name": "Mei-Rong Alice Chen"}, {"id": "1485372834", "name": "Darmawansah Darmawansah"}], "fields_of_study": ["Psychology", "Computer Science"]}

Many taxonomies for XAI methods of varying level of detail and depth can be found in the literature. While they often have a different focus, they also exhibit many points of overlap. This paper unifies these efforts and provides a complete taxonomy of XAI methods with respect to notions present in the current state of research. In a structured literature analysis and meta-study, we identified and reviewed more than 50 of the most cited and current surveys on XAI methods, metrics, and method traits. After summarizing them in a survey of surveys, we merge terminologies and concepts of the articles into a unified structured taxonomy. Single concepts therein are illustrated by more than 50 diverse selected example methods in total, which we categorize accordingly. The taxonomy may serve both beginners, researchers, and practitioners as a reference and wide-ranging overview of XAI method traits and aspects.

The literature to date lacks a decision-making framework for identifying and applying powerful AI techniques to build supply-chain resilience (SCRes), curbing advances in research and practice on this interesting interface. In this paper, we propose an integrated Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique powered by AI-based algorithms such as Fuzzy systems, Wavelet Neural Networks (WNN) and Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) to identify patterns in AI techniques for developing different SCRes strategies. The analysis was informed by data collected from 479 manufacturing companies to determine the most significant AI applications used for SCRes. The findings show that fuzzy logic programming, machine learning big data, and agent-based systems are the most promising techniques used to promote SCRes strategies.

This article explores the issues related to human capabilities to work with AI. A key to working in many work arrangements is the ability to delegate work to entities that can do them most efficiently. Modern AI can do a remarkable job of efficient delegation to humans because it knows what it knows well and what it does not. Humans, on the other hand, are poor judges of their metaknowledge and are not good at delegating knowledge work to AI—this might prove to be a big stumbling block to create work environments where humans and AI work together. Humans have often created machines to serve them. The sentiment is perhaps exemplified by Oscar Wilde’s statement that “civilization requires slaves…. Human slavery is wrong, insecure and demoralizing. On mechanical slavery, on the slavery of the machine, the future of the world depends.” However, the time has come when humans might switch roles with machines. Our study highlights capabilities that humans need to effectively work with AI and still be in control rather than just being directed."}, "authors": [{"id": "2251595", "name": "A.

Such factors were divided into those relating to (a) the human trustor, (b) the AI trustee, and (c) the shared context of their interaction. Background There are many factors influencing trust in robots, automation, and technology in general, and there have been several meta-analytic attempts to understand the antecedents of trust in these areas. However, no targeted meta-analysis has been performed examining the antecedents of trust in AI. Method Data from 65 articles examined the three predicted categories, as well as the subcategories of human characteristics and abilities, AI performance and attributes, and contextual tasking. Lastly, four common uses for AI (i.e., chatbots, robots, automated vehicles, and nonembodied, plain algorithms) were examined as further potential moderating factors. Results Results showed that all of the examined categories were significant predictors of trust in AI as well as many individual antecedents such as AI reliability and anthropomorphism, among many others. Conclusion Overall, the results of this meta-analysis determined several factors that influence trust, including some that have no bearing on AI performance.

Design Systematic review of test accuracy studies. Data sources Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 1 January 2010 to 17 May 2021. Eligibility criteria Studies reporting test accuracy of AI algorithms, alone or in combination with radiologists, to detect cancer in women’s digital mammograms in screening practice, or in test sets. Reference standard was biopsy with histology or follow-up (for screen negative women). Outcomes included test accuracy and cancer type detected. Study selection and synthesis Two reviewers independently assessed articles for inclusion and assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the QUality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. A single reviewer extracted data, which were checked by a second reviewer. Narrative data synthesis was performed. Results Twelve studies totalling 131 822 screened women were included. No prospective studies measuring test accuracy of AI in screening practice were found. Studies were of poor methodological quality. Three retrospective studies compared AI systems with the clinical decisions of the original radiologist, including 79 910 women, of whom 1878 had screen detected cancer or interval cancer within 12 months of screening. Thirty four (94%) of 36 AI systems evaluated in these studies were less accurate than a single radiologist, and all were less accurate than consensus of two or more radiologists. Five smaller studies (1086 women, 520 cancers) at high risk of bias and low generalisability to the clinical context reported that all five evaluated AI systems (as standalone to replace radiologist or as a reader aid) were more accurate than a single radiologist reading a test set in the laboratory. In three studies, AI used for triage screened out 53%, 45%, and 50% of women at low risk but also 10%, 4%, and 0% of cancers detected by radiologists. Conclusions Current evidence for AI does not yet allow judgement of its accuracy in breast cancer screening programmes, and it is unclear where on the clinical pathway AI might be of most benefit. AI systems are not sufficiently specific to replace radiologist double reading in screening programmes. Promising results in smaller studies are not replicated in larger studies. Prospective studies are required to measure the effect of AI in clinical practice. Such studies will require clear stopping rules to ensure that AI does not reduce programme specificity.

This interesting finding challenges previous insights into technology adoption and value co-creation as analytical AI puts customers into a very passive role and reduces barriers to technology adoption. The research also analyzes how consumers become aware of robo-advisors, and how this influences their acceptance.Originality/valueThis is the first study to analyze the role of customers' technology readiness in the adoption of analytical AI. The authors link the findings to previous technology adoption and automated services' literature and provide specific managerial implications and avenues for further research."}, "authors": [{"id": "7751133", "name": "C.

Methods We established the Nursing and Artificial Intelligence Leadership (NAIL) Collaborative, comprising interdisciplinary experts in AI development, biomedical ethics, AI in primary care, AI legal aspects, philosophy of AI in health, nursing practice, implementation science, leaders in health informatics practice and international health informatics groups, a representative of patients and the public, and the Chair of the ITU/WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health. The NAIL Collaborative convened at a 3‐day invitational think tank in autumn 2019. Activities included a pre‐event survey, expert presentations and working sessions to identify priority areas for action, opportunities and recommendations to address these. In this paper, we summarize the key discussion points and notes from the aforementioned activities. Implications for nursing Nursing's limited current engagement with discourses on AI and health posts a risk that the profession is not part of the conversations that have potentially significant impacts on nursing practice. Conclusion There are numerous gaps and a timely need for the nursing profession to be among the leaders and drivers of conversations around AI in health systems. Impact We outline crucial gaps where focused effort is required for nursing to take a leadership role in shaping AI use in health systems. Three priorities were identified that need to be addressed in the near future: (a) Nurses must understand the relationship between the data they collect and AI technologies they use; (b) Nurses need to be meaningfully involved in all stages of AI: from development to implementation; and (c) There is a substantial untapped and an unexplored potential for nursing to contribute to the development of AI technologies for global health and humanitarian efforts."}, "authors": [{"id": "2371504", "name": "C.

However, it is very likely that AI applications will acquire many of their roles and generate new tasks in medical care. To be ready for new roles and tasks, medical students and physicians will need to understand the fundamentals of AI and data science, mathematical concepts, and related ethical and medico-legal issues in addition with the standard medical principles. Nevertheless, there is no valid and reliable instrument available in the literature to measure medical AI readiness. In this study, we have described the development of a valid and reliable psychometric measurement tool for the assessment of the perceived readiness of medical students on AI technologies and its applications in medicine. To define medical students’ required competencies on AI, a diverse set of experts’ opinions were obtained by a qualitative method and were used as a theoretical framework, while creating the item pool of the scale. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were applied. A total of 568 medical students during the EFA phase and 329 medical students during the CFA phase, enrolled in two different public universities in Turkey participated in this study. The initial 27-items finalized with a 22-items scale in a four-factor structure (cognition, ability, vision, and ethics), which explains 50.9% cumulative variance that resulted from the EFA. Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficient was 0.87. CFA indicated appropriate fit of the four-factor model (χ2/df = 3.81, RMSEA = 0.094, SRMR = 0.057, CFI = 0.938, and NNFI (TLI) = 0.928). These values showed that the four-factor model has construct validity. The newly developed Medical Artificial Intelligence Readiness Scale for Medical Students (MAIRS-MS) was found to be valid and reliable tool for evaluation and monitoring of perceived readiness levels of medical students on AI technologies and applications. Medical schools may follow ‘a physician training perspective that is compatible with AI in medicine’ to their curricula by using MAIRS-MS. This scale could be benefitted by medical and health science education institutions as a valuable curriculum development tool with its learner needs assessment and participants’ end-course perceived readiness opportunities."}, "authors": [{"id": "67024083", "name": "Ozan Karaca"}, {"id": "1420130493", "name": "S.

Purpose To assess the effect of assistance by artificial intelligence (AI) on diagnostic performances of physicians for fractures on radiographs. Materials and Methods This retrospective diagnostic study used the multi-reader, multi-case methodology based on an external multicenter data set of 480 examinations with at least 60 examinations per body region (foot and ankle, knee and leg, hip and pelvis, hand and wrist, elbow and arm, shoulder and clavicle, rib cage, and thoracolumbar spine) between July 2020 and January 2021. Fracture prevalence was set at 50%. The ground truth was determined by two musculoskeletal radiologists, with discrepancies solved by a third. Twenty-four readers (radiologists, orthopedists, emergency physicians, physician assistants, rheumatologists, family physicians) were presented the whole validation data set (n = 480), with and without AI assistance, with a 1-month minimum washout period. The primary analysis had to demonstrate superiority of sensitivity per patient and the noninferiority of specificity per patient at -3% margin with AI aid. Stand-alone AI performance was also assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves. Results A total of 480 patients were included (mean age, 59 years ± 16 [standard deviation]; 327 women). The sensitivity per patient was 10.4% higher (95% CI: 6.9, 13.9; P < .001 for superiority) with AI aid (4331 of 5760 readings, 75.2%) than without AI (3732 of 5760 readings, 64.8%). The specificity per patient with AI aid (5504 of 5760 readings, 95.6%) was noninferior to that without AI aid (5217 of 5760 readings, 90.6%), with a difference of +5.0% (95% CI: +2.0, +8.0; P = .001 for noninferiority). AI shortened the average reading time by 6.3 seconds per examination (95% CI: -12.5, -0.1; P = .046). The sensitivity by patient gain was significant in all regions (+8.0% to +16.2%; P < .05) but shoulder and clavicle and spine (+4.2% and +2.6%; P = .12 and .52). Conclusion AI assistance improved the sensitivity and may even improve the specificity of fracture detection by radiologists and nonradiologists, without lengthening reading time. © RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

This paper attempts to present an overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI). A generally accepted theory that ―machine will do and think like humans more in the future‖ is the concept behind AI. Brief literature of different aspects by which AI is achieved like expert system, knowledge based systems (knowledge engineering), neural networks, fuzzy logic, Neuro-fuzzy logic and fuzzy expert system, is included in order to have a clear understanding of AI. Along with this the different applications of AI, has been included in this paper.

To achieve herd immunity, widespread administration of vaccines is required, which necessitates significant cooperation from the general public. As such, it is crucial that governments and public health agencies understand public sentiments toward vaccines, which can help guide educational campaigns and other targeted policy interventions. Objective The aim of this study was to develop and apply an artificial intelligence–based approach to analyze public sentiments on social media in the United Kingdom and the United States toward COVID-19 vaccines to better understand the public attitude and concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccines. Methods Over 300,000 social media posts related to COVID-19 vaccines were extracted, including 23,571 Facebook posts from the United Kingdom and 144,864 from the United States, along with 40,268 tweets from the United Kingdom and 98,385 from the United States from March 1 to November 22, 2020. We used natural language processing and deep learning–based techniques to predict average sentiments, sentiment trends, and topics of discussion. These factors were analyzed longitudinally and geospatially, and manual reading of randomly selected posts on points of interest helped identify underlying themes and validated insights from the analysis. Results Overall averaged positive, negative, and neutral sentiments were at 58%, 22%, and 17% in the United Kingdom, compared to 56%, 24%, and 18% in the United States, respectively. Public optimism over vaccine development, effectiveness, and trials as well as concerns over their safety, economic viability, and corporation control were identified. We compared our findings to those of nationwide surveys in both countries and found them to correlate broadly. Conclusions Artificial intelligence–enabled social media analysis should be considered for adoption by institutions and governments alongside surveys and other conventional methods of assessing public attitude. Such analyses could enable real-time assessment, at scale, of public confidence and trust in COVID-19 vaccines, help address the concerns of vaccine sceptics, and help develop more effective policies and communication strategies to maximize uptake."}, "authors": [{"id": "145125161", "name": "A.

Trained without hard-coded rules by finding often subclinical patterns in huge datasets, AI transforms the ECG, a ubiquitous, non-invasive cardiac test that is integrated into practice workflows, into a screening tool and predictor of cardiac and non-cardiac diseases, often in asymptomatic individuals. This review describes the mathematical background behind supervised AI algorithms, and discusses selected AI ECG cardiac screening algorithms including those for the detection of left ventricular dysfunction, episodic atrial fibrillation from a tracing recorded during normal sinus rhythm, and other structural and valvular diseases. The ability to learn from big data sets, without the need to understand the biological mechanism, has created opportunities for detecting non-cardiac diseases as COVID-19 and introduced challenges with regards to data privacy. Like all medical tests, the AI ECG must be carefully vetted and validated in real-world clinical environments.

However, intelligent decision-making in such vehicles is not generally understandable by humans in the current state of the art, and such deficiency hinders this technology from being socially acceptable. Hence, aside from making safe real-time decisions, AVs must also explain their AI-guided decision-making process in order to be regulatory-compliant across many jurisdictions.

The widespread adoption of machine learning, in particular deep learning, in multiple scientific disciplines, and the advances in computing hardware and software, among other factors, continue to fuel this development. Much of the initial skepticism regarding applications of AI in pharmaceutical discovery has started to vanish, consequently benefitting medicinal chemistry. Areas covered: The current status of AI in chemoinformatics is reviewed. The topics discussed herein include quantitative structure-activity/property relationship and structure-based modeling, de novo molecular design, and chemical synthesis prediction. Advantages and limitations of current deep learning applications are highlighted, together with a perspective on next-generation AI for drug discovery. Expert opinion: Deep learning-based approaches have only begun to address some fundamental problems in drug discovery. Certain methodological advances, such as message-passing models, spatial-symmetry-preserving networks, hybrid de novo design, and other innovative machine learning paradigms, will likely become commonplace and help address some of the most challenging questions.

The eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important to interpret the machine learning models to enhance trust management by allowing human experts to understand the underlying data evidence and causal reasoning. According to IDS, the critical role of trust management is to understand the impact of the malicious data to detect any intrusion in the system. The previous studies focused more on the accuracy of the various classification algorithms for trust in IDS. They do not often provide insights into their behavior and reasoning provided by the sophisticated algorithm. Therefore, in this paper, we have addressed XAI concept to enhance trust management by exploring the decision tree model in the area of IDS. We use simple decision tree algorithms that can be easily read and even resemble a human approach to decision-making by splitting the choice into many small subchoices for IDS. We experimented with this approach by extracting rules in a widely used KDD benchmark dataset. We also compared the accuracy of the decision tree approach with the other state-of-the-art algorithms."}, "authors": [{"id": "31002592", "name": "Basim Mahbooba"}, {"id": "2353849465", "name": "Mohan Timilsina"}, {"id": "3298018", "name": "Radhya Sahal"}, {"id": "143667628", "name": "M.

A challenge for traditional methods in quality management is to handle high-dimensional and nonlinear manufacturing data. We address this challenge by adapting explainable artificial intelligence to the context of quality management. Specifically, we propose the use of nonlinear modeling with Shapley additive explanations to infer how a set of production parameters and the process quality of a manufacturing system are related. Thereby, we contribute a measure of process importance based on which manufacturers can prioritize processes for quality improvement. Grounded in quality management theory, our decision model selects improvement actions that target the sources of quality variation. The decision model is validated in a real-world application at a leading manufacturer of high-power semiconductors. Seeking to improve production yield, we apply our decision model to select improvement actions for a transistor chip product. We then conduct a field experiment to confirm the effectiveness of the improvement actions. Compared with the average yield in our sample, the experiment returns a reduction in yield loss of 21.7%. Furthermore, we report on results from a postexperimental rollout of the decision model, which also resulted in significant yield improvements. We demonstrate the operational value of explainable artificial intelligence by showing that critical drivers of process quality can go undiscovered by the use of traditional methods.

Typically, canonical knowledge representations and modern representations each emphasize a particular aspect of transforming inputs into symbolic encoding or vectors. For example, knowledge graphs focus on depicting semantic connections among concepts, whereas deep neural networks (DNNs) are more of a tool to perceive raw signal inputs. MKR is an advanced AI representation framework for more complete intelligent functions, such as raw signal perception, feature extraction and vectorization, knowledge symbolization, and logical reasoning. MKR has two benefits: (1) it makes the current AI techniques (dominated by deep learning) more explainable and generalizable, and (2) it expands current AI techniques by integrating MKR to facilitate the mutual benefits of the complementary capacity of each representation, e.g., raw signal perception and symbolic encoding.

Our review herein aims to provide in-depth knowledge and analysis of the AI applications in CRC screening, diagnosis, and treatment based on current literature. We also explore the role of recent advances in AI systems regarding medical diagnosis and therapy, with several promising results. CRC is a highly preventable disease, and AI-assisted techniques in routine screening represent a pivotal step in declining incidence rates of this malignancy. So far, computer-aided detection and characterization systems have been developed to increase the detection rate of adenomas. Furthermore, CRC treatment enters a new era with robotic surgery and novel computer-assisted drug delivery techniques. At the same time, healthcare is rapidly moving toward precision or personalized medicine. Machine learning models have the potential to contribute to individual-based cancer care and transform the future of medicine."}, "authors": [{"id": "116115650", "name": "Athanasia Mitsala"}, {"id": "6646980", "name": "C.

This study applies the technology acceptance model (TAM) of Davis (1989) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB) of Ajzen (1991) to investigate which behavioral factors are influencing the acceptance of AI in agriculture. The composite model is extended by two additional factors, expectation of property rights over business data and personal innovativeness. A structural equation analysis is used to determine the importance of factors influencing the acceptance of AI systems in agriculture. For this purpose, 84 farmers were surveyed with a letter or an online questionnaire. Results show that the perceived behavioral control has the greatest influence on acceptance, followed by farmers’ personal attitude towards AI systems in agriculture. The modelled relationships explain 59% of the total variance in acceptance. Several options and implications on how to increase the acceptance of AI systems in agriculture are discussed."}, "authors": [{"id": "2120486599", "name": "Svenja Mohr"}, {"id": "33104892", "name": "R.

This study explored the role of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in speaking practice for FLA management of 48 undergraduate participants in an EFL class in Egypt. An eight‐week, quasi‐experimental pretest–posttest design examined learner anxiety levels using a 33‐item FLA questionnaire. Their oral proficiency was assessed via roleplaying using an interaction‐enhanced public version of the IELTS speaking evaluation rubric. The results confirmed that FL learners experienced FLA pre‐ and post‐intervention. The identified anxiety levels played a facilitative role in FL learning with several ensuing gains. The use of conversationally enhanced AI chatbots in interactive activities slightly intensified learners' FLA, thus meriting further investigation of these objectives. Overall, subject to further development, AI chatbots are promising for significantly improving linguistic output gains; however, this study found that learners' speech‐related anxieties were not reduced following the interactions with the chatbots. It is concluded that FLA plays an underexplored facilitative role in sharpening learner cognitive faculties and linguistic capacities. Moreover, AI chatbots may be beneficial in advancing FL learning with significant potential in EFL contexts, facilitating improved interaction and oral communication. These findings support the integration of AI technologies as effective tools in FL education, providing flexible, interactive, and learner‐centred learning. This study is expected to be of considerable interest to FL educators and learners."}, "authors": [{"id": "1583666685", "name": "R. E. Shazly"}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science"]}

Increasingly, researchers are exploring the potential influences of AI health technologies (AIHTs) on nursing in general and on nursing education more specifically. However, little emphasis has been placed on synthesizing this body of literature. Objective A scoping review was conducted to summarize the current and predicted influences of AIHTs on nursing education over the next 10 years and beyond. Methods This scoping review followed a previously published protocol from April 2020. Using an established scoping review methodology, the databases of MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central, Education Resources Information Centre, Scopus, Web of Science, and Proquest were searched. In addition to the use of these electronic databases, a targeted website search was performed to access relevant grey literature. Abstracts and full-text studies were independently screened by two reviewers using prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included literature focused on nursing education and digital health technologies that incorporate AI. Data were charted using a structured form and narratively summarized into categories. Results A total of 27 articles were identified (20 expository papers, six studies with quantitative or prototyping methods, and one qualitative study). The population included nurses, nurse educators, and nursing students at the entry-to-practice, undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral levels. A variety of AIHTs were discussed, including virtual avatar apps, smart homes, predictive analytics, virtual or augmented reality, and robots. The two key categories derived from the literature were (1) influences of AI on nursing education in academic institutions and (2) influences of AI on nursing education in clinical practice. Conclusions Curricular reform is urgently needed within nursing education programs in academic institutions and clinical practice settings to prepare nurses and nursing students to practice safely and efficiently in the age of AI. Additionally, nurse educators need to adopt new and evolving pedagogies that incorporate AI to better support students at all levels of education. Finally, nursing students and practicing nurses must be equipped with the requisite knowledge and skills to effectively assess AIHTs and safely integrate those deemed appropriate to support person-centered compassionate nursing care in practice settings.

Purpose Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing phenomenon poised to instigate large-scale changes in medicine. However, medical education has not kept pace with the rapid advancements of AI. Despite several calls to action, the adoption of teaching on AI in undergraduate medical education (UME) has been limited. This scoping review aims to identify gaps and key themes in the peer-reviewed literature on AI training in UME. Method The scoping review was informed by Arksey and O’Malley’s methodology. Seven electronic databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for articles discussing the inclusion of AI in UME between January 2000 and July 2020. A total of 4,299 articles were independently screened by 3 co-investigators and 22 full-text articles were included. Data were extracted using a standardized checklist. Themes were identified using iterative thematic analysis. Results The literature addressed: (1) a need for an AI curriculum in UME, (2) recommendations for AI curricular content including machine learning literacy and AI ethics, (3) suggestions for curriculum delivery, (4) an emphasis on cultivating “uniquely human skills” such as empathy in response to AI-driven changes, and (5) challenges with introducing an AI curriculum in UME. However, there was considerable heterogeneity and poor consensus across studies regarding AI curricular content and delivery. Conclusions Despite the large volume of literature, there is little consensus on what and how to teach AI in UME. Further research is needed to address these discrepancies and create a standardized framework of competencies that can facilitate greater adoption and implementation of a standardized AI curriculum in UME."}, "authors": [{"id": "2108334706", "name": "Juehea Lee"}, {"id": "2147235297", "name": "Annie Siyu Wu"}, {"id": "2108634766", "name": "David Li"}, {"id": "4848923", "name": "K.

While photographic images are rarely used in clinical practice for diagnostic purposes, they are the fundamental requirement for automated image analysis when using artificial intelligence (AI) methods. Considering that AI has not been used for automatic caries detection on intraoral images so far, this diagnostic study aimed to develop a deep learning approach with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for caries detection and categorization (test method) and to compare the diagnostic performance with respect to expert standards. The study material consisted of 2,417 anonymized photographs from permanent teeth with 1,317 occlusal and 1,100 smooth surfaces. All the images were evaluated into the following categories: caries free, noncavitated caries lesion, or caries-related cavitation. Each expert diagnosis served as a reference standard for cyclic training and repeated evaluation of the AI methods. The CNN was trained using image augmentation and transfer learning. Before training, the entire image set was divided into a training and test set. Validation was conducted by selecting 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the available images from the training set. The statistical analysis included calculations of the sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). The CNN was able to correctly detect caries in 92.5% of cases when all test images were considered (SE, 89.6; SP, 94.3; AUC, 0.964). If the threshold of caries-related cavitation was chosen, 93.3% of all tooth surfaces were correctly classified (SE, 95.7; SP, 81.5; AUC, 0.955). It can be concluded that it was possible to achieve more than 90% agreement in caries detection using the AI method with standardized, single-tooth photographs. Nevertheless, the current approach needs further improvement."}, "authors": [{"id": "5484679", "name": "J. Kühnisch"}, {"id": "145533859", "name": "O. Meyer"}, {"id": "3056027", "name": "M.

To which extent this effect may be related to physician experience is not known. We performed a randomised trial with colonoscopists in their qualification period (AID-2) and compared these data with a previously published randomised trial in expert endoscopists (AID-1). Methods In this prospective, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial (AID-2), 10 non-expert endoscopists (<2000 colonoscopies) performed screening/surveillance/diagnostic colonoscopies in consecutive 40–80 year-old subjects using high-definition colonoscopy with or without a real-time deep-learning computer-aided detection (CADe) (GI Genius, Medtronic). The primary outcome was ADR in both groups with histology of resected lesions as reference. In a post-hoc analysis, data from this randomised controlled trial (RCT) were compared with data from the previous AID-1 RCT involving six experienced endoscopists in an otherwise similar setting. Results In 660 patients (62.3±10 years; men/women: 330/330) with equal distribution of study parameters, overall ADR was higher in the CADe than in the control group (53.3% vs 44.5%; relative risk (RR): 1.22; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.40; p<0.01 for non-inferiority and p=0.02 for superiority). Similar increases were seen in adenoma numbers per colonoscopy and in small and distal lesions. No differences were observed with regards to detection of non-neoplastic lesions. When pooling these data with those from the AID-1 study, use of CADe (RR 1.29; 95% CI: 1.16 to 1.42) and colonoscopy indication, but not the level of examiner experience (RR 1.02; 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.16) were associated with ADR differences in a multivariate analysis. Conclusions In less experienced examiners, CADe assistance during colonoscopy increased ADR and a number of related polyp parameters as compared with the control group. Experience appears to play a minor role as determining factor for ADR. Trial registration number NCT:04260321."}, "authors": [{"id": "6652909", "name": "A. Repici"}, {"id": "17720614", "name": "M.

In the quantitative study, a total of 302 completed questionnaires were received from Malaysian banking customers. The data were analysed using the SmartPLS 3.0 software to identify the important predictors of their intention to adopt AI.FindingsThe qualitative results reveal that AI is an essential tool for fraud detection and risk prevention. The absence of regulatory requirements, data privacy and security, and lack of relevant skills and IT infrastructure are significant challenges of AI adoption. The quantitative results indicate that attitude towards AI, perceived usefulness, perceived risk, perceived trust, and subjective norms significantly influence intention to adopt AI in banking services while perceived ease of use and awareness do not. The results also show that attitude towards AI significantly mediates the relationship between perceived usefulness and intention to adopt AI in banking services.Practical implicationsFinancial technology (FinTech) is regarded as a critical determinant of strategic planning in the banking industry. While AI provides various disruptive opportunities in the FinTech space in terms of data collection, analysis, safeguarding and streamlining processes, it also poses a sea of threats to incumbent banks. This study provides vital insights for the policymakers of the banking industry to address the challenges of adopting AI in banking. It also provides the important predictors of the bank customers' intention to adopt AI in banking services. Policymakers can devise their strategies to enhance AI adoption considering the facts.Originality/valueThis study is amongst the pioneer in exploring the importance and potential challenges in implementing AI technology in banking services and identifying the essential factors influencing the intention to adopt AI in Malaysia's banking services."}, "authors": [{"id": "47720977", "name": "Mahfuzur Rahman"}, {"id": "2148552771", "name": "Teoh Hui Ming"}, {"id": "2088955759", "name": "Tarannum Azim Baigh"}, {"id": "2135437025", "name": "M.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and its subfields of machine learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning are well-suited to deal with such data. The authors in this paper review current applications of AI in clinical medicine and discuss the most likely future contributions that AI will provide to the healthcare industry. For instance, in response to the need to risk stratify patients, appropriately cultivated and curated data can assist decision-makers in stratifying preoperative patients into risk categories, as well as categorizing the severity of ailments and health for non-operative patients admitted to hospitals. Previous overt, traditional vital signs and laboratory values that are used to signal alarms for an acutely decompensating patient may be replaced by continuously monitoring and updating AI tools that can pick up early imperceptible patterns predicting subtle health deterioration. Furthermore, AI may help overcome challenges with multiple outcome optimization limitations or sequential decision-making protocols that limit individualized patient care. Despite these tremendously helpful advancements, the data sets that AI models train on and develop have the potential for misapplication and thereby create concerns for application bias. Subsequently, the mechanisms governing this disruptive innovation must be understood by clinical decision-makers to prevent unnecessary harm. This need will force physicians to change their educational infrastructure to facilitate understanding AI platforms, modeling, and limitations to best acclimate practice in the age of AI. By performing a thorough narrative review, this paper examines these specific AI applications, limitations, and requisites while reviewing a few examples of major data sets that are being cultivated and curated in the US."}, "authors": [{"id": "2133940", "name": "C.

In recent years, however, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been increasingly used to augment or even replace classical ESM tasks, raising hopes that AI could solve some of the grand challenges of climate science. In this Perspective we survey the recent achievements and limitations of both process-based models and AI in Earth system and climate research, and propose a methodological transformation in which deep neural networks and ESMs are dismantled as individual approaches and reassembled as learning, self-validating and interpretable ESM–network hybrids. Following this path, we coin the term neural Earth system modelling. We examine the concurrent potential and pitfalls of neural Earth system modelling and discuss the open question of whether AI can bolster ESMs or even ultimately render them obsolete. In the past few years, AI approaches have been used to enhance Earth and climate modelling. This Perspective examines the opportunity to go further, and build from scratch hybrid systems that integrate AI tools and models based on physical process knowledge to make more efficient use of daily observational data streams."}, "authors": [{"id": "104343166", "name": "C.

However, its current form, STARD 2015 does not address the issues and challenges raised by artificial intelligence (AI)-centred interventions. As such, we propose an AI-specific version of the STARD checklist (STARD-AI), which focuses on the reporting of AI diagnostic test accuracy studies. This paper describes the methods that will be used to develop STARD-AI. Methods and analysis The development of the STARD-AI checklist can be distilled into six stages. (1) A project organisation phase has been undertaken, during which a Project Team and a Steering Committee were established; (2) An item generation process has been completed following a literature review, a patient and public involvement and engagement exercise and an online scoping survey of international experts; (3) A three-round modified Delphi consensus methodology is underway, which will culminate in a teleconference consensus meeting of experts; (4) Thereafter, the Project Team will draft the initial STARD-AI checklist and the accompanying documents; (5) A piloting phase among expert users will be undertaken to identify items which are either unclear or missing. This process, consisting of surveys and semistructured interviews, will contribute towards the explanation and elaboration document and (6) On finalisation of the manuscripts, the group’s efforts turn towards an organised dissemination and implementation strategy to maximise end-user adoption. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been granted by the Joint Research Compliance Office at Imperial College London (reference number: 19IC5679).

Most attempts at using AI to improve efficiencies in cities have nevertheless either struggled or failed to accomplish the smart city transformation.

Besides this, as smart cities are underpinned by our ability to engage with our environments, analyze them, and make efficient, sustainable and equitable decisions, the need for a green AI approach is intensified. This perspective paper, reflecting authors’ opinions and interpretations, concentrates on the “green AI” concept as an enabler of the smart city transformation, as it offers the opportunity to move away from purely technocentric efficiency solutions towards efficient, sustainable and equitable solutions capable of realizing the desired urban futures. The aim of this perspective paper is two-fold: first, to highlight the fundamental shortfalls in mainstream AI system conceptualization and practice, and second, to advocate the need for a consolidated AI approach—i.e., green AI—to further support smart city transformation. The methodological approach includes a thorough appraisal of the current AI and smart city literatures, practices, developments, trends and applications.

Specifically, the study design, study aim, dataset size, level of validation, level of readiness, and the outcomes of clinical trials were extracted. Risk of bias in individual studies was evaluated by the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST). Out of 6455 studies identified through literature search, 494 were included. The most common study design was retrospective [476 studies (96.4% of all studies)] followed by prospective observational [8 (1.6%)] and clinical [10 (2%)] trials. 378 (80.9%) retrospective studies were classified as high risk of bias. No studies were identified that reported on the outcome evaluation of an AI model integrated in routine clinical practice.

Yet the increased visibility of the technology’s risks has led to ever-louder calls for regulators to look beyond the benefits, and also secure appropriate regulation to ensure AI that is ‘trustworthy’ – i.e. legal, ethical and robust. Besides minimising risks, such regulation could facilitate AI’s uptake, boost legal certainty, and hence also contribute to advancing countries’ position in the race. Consequently, this paper argues that the ‘race to AI’ also brings forth a ‘race to AI regulation’. After discussing the regulatory toolbox for AI and some of the challenges that regulators face when making use thereof, this paper assesses to which extent regulatory competition for AI – or its counterpart, regulatory convergence – is a possibility, a reality and a desirability."}, "authors": [{"id": "134533029", "name": "Nathalie A.

We investigate the social consequences of one of the most pervasive AI applications, algorithmic response suggestions (“smart replies”), which are used to send billions of messages each day. Two randomized experiments provide evidence that these types of algorithmic recommender systems change how people interact with and perceive one another in both pro-social and anti-social ways. We find that using algorithmic responses changes language and social relationships. More specifically, it increases communication speed, use of positive emotional language, and conversation partners evaluate each other as closer and more cooperative. However, consistent with common assumptions about the adverse effects of AI, people are evaluated more negatively if they are suspected to be using algorithmic responses. Thus, even though AI can increase the speed of communication and improve interpersonal perceptions, the prevailing anti-social connotations of AI undermine these potential benefits if used overtly."}, "authors": [{"id": "35778351", "name": "Jess Hohenstein"}, {"id": "1771597", "name": "Dominic DiFranzo"}, {"id": "2633430", "name": "René F.

As studies on attitudes toward AI have primarily focused on physicians, there is a need to assess the perspectives of students across health care disciplines to inform future curriculum development. Objective This study aims to explore and identify gaps in the knowledge that Canadian health care students have regarding AI, capture how health care students in different fields differ in their knowledge and perspectives on AI, and present student-identified ways that AI literacy may be incorporated into the health care curriculum. Methods The survey was developed from a narrative literature review of topics in attitudinal surveys on AI. The final survey comprised 15 items, including multiple-choice questions, pick-group-rank questions, 11-point Likert scale items, slider scale questions, and narrative questions. We used snowball and convenience sampling methods by distributing an email with a description and a link to the web-based survey to representatives from 18 Canadian schools. Results A total of 2167 students across 10 different health professions from 18 universities across Canada responded to the survey. Overall, 78.77% (1707/2167) predicted that AI technology would affect their careers within the coming decade and 74.5% (1595/2167) reported a positive outlook toward the emerging role of AI in their respective fields. Attitudes toward AI varied by discipline. Students, even those opposed to AI, identified the need to incorporate a basic understanding of AI into their curricula. Conclusions We performed a nationwide survey of health care students across 10 different health professions in Canada. The findings would inform student-identified topics within AI and their preferred delivery formats, which would advance education across different health care professions."}, "authors": [{"id": "115860076", "name": "Minnie Teng"}, {"id": "2048022805", "name": "Rohit Singla"}, {"id": "47660639", "name": "O.

However, because of a lack of AI literacy, most HCPs are not adequately prepared for this revolution. This is a significant barrier to adopting and implementing AI that will affect patients. In addition, the limited existing AI education programs face barriers to development and implementation at various levels of medical education. Objective With a view to informing future AI education programs for HCPs, this scoping review aims to provide an overview of the types of current or past AI education programs that pertains to the programs’ curricular content, modes of delivery, critical implementation factors for education delivery, and outcomes used to assess the programs’ effectiveness. Methods After the creation of a search strategy and keyword searches, a 2-stage screening process was conducted by 2 independent reviewers to determine study eligibility. When consensus was not reached, the conflict was resolved by consulting a third reviewer. This process consisted of a title and abstract scan and a full-text review. The articles were included if they discussed an actual training program or educational intervention, or a potential training program or educational intervention and the desired content to be covered, focused on AI, and were designed or intended for HCPs (at any stage of their career). Results Of the 10,094 unique citations scanned, 41 (0.41%) studies relevant to our eligibility criteria were identified. Among the 41 included studies, 10 (24%) described 13 unique programs and 31 (76%) discussed recommended curricular content. The curricular content of the unique programs ranged from AI use, AI interpretation, and cultivating skills to explain results derived from AI algorithms. The curricular topics were categorized into three main domains: cognitive, psychomotor, and affective. Conclusions This review provides an overview of the current landscape of AI in medical education and highlights the skills and competencies required by HCPs to effectively use AI in enhancing the quality of care and optimizing patient outcomes.

However, training robust AI systems requires large datasets for which data collection faces practical, ethical and legal obstacles. These obstacles could be overcome with swarm learning (SL), in which partners jointly train AI models while avoiding data transfer and monopolistic data governance. Here, we demonstrate the successful use of SL in large, multicentric datasets of gigapixel histopathology images from over 5,000 patients. We show that AI models trained using SL can predict BRAF mutational status and microsatellite instability directly from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained pathology slides of colorectal cancer. We trained AI models on three patient cohorts from Northern Ireland, Germany and the United States, and validated the prediction performance in two independent datasets from the United Kingdom. Our data show that SL-trained AI models outperform most locally trained models, and perform on par with models that are trained on the merged datasets. In addition, we show that SL-based AI models are data efficient. In the future, SL can be used to train distributed AI models for any histopathology image analysis task, eliminating the need for data transfer. A decentralized, privacy-preserving machine learning framework used to train a clinically relevant AI system identifies actionable molecular alterations in patients with colorectal cancer by use of routine histopathology slides collected in real-world settings."}, "authors": [{"id": "2123060192", "name": "O.

We intend to fill this gap as we present the Cognitive Immersive Language Learning Environment (CILLE). The AI in CILLE can hear, see, and understand its users and can engage with them in non-dyadic multimodal conversations. The XR offers students a feeling of being somewhere else without the use of intrusive devices and supports multi-party, multi-modal interactions. Together, AI and XR create naturalistic conversational interactions targeted towards comprehensive foreign language acquisition. We evaluate CILLE as a Chinese-as-a-foreign-language (CFL) education tool through a seven-week, mixed-methods study with university students (N = 10).

However, AI and ML should also be used cautiously, due to potential issues of fairness and algorithmic bias that may arise if not applied properly. Furthermore, populations in LMICs can be particularly vulnerable to bias and fairness in AI algorithms, due to a lack of technical capacity, existing social bias against minority groups, and a lack of legal protections. In order to address the need for better guidance within the context of global health, we describe three basic criteria (Appropriateness, Fairness, and Bias) that can be used to help evaluate the use of machine learning and AI systems: 1) APPROPRIATENESS is the process of deciding how the algorithm should be used in the local context, and properly matching the machine learning model to the target population; 2) BIAS is a systematic tendency in a model to favor one demographic group vs another, which can be mitigated but can lead to unfairness; and 3) FAIRNESS involves examining the impact on various demographic groups and choosing one of several mathematical definitions of group fairness that will adequately satisfy the desired set of legal, cultural, and ethical requirements. Finally, we illustrate how these principles can be applied using a case study of machine learning applied to the diagnosis and screening of pulmonary disease in Pune, India. We hope that these methods and principles can help guide researchers and organizations working in global health who are considering the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence."}, "authors": [{"id": "2275442345", "name": "Richard Ribón Fletcher"}, {"id": "1394971918", "name": "Audace Nakeshimana"}, {"id": "1413631950", "name": "Olasubomi Olubeko"}], "fields_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"]}

Drawing on an exploratory case study and the recently proposed concept of envelopment, it describes a case of an organization successfully “enveloping” its AI solutions to balance the performance benefits of flexible AI models with the risks that inscrutable models can entail. The authors present several envelopment methods—establishing clear boundaries within which the AI is to interact with its surroundings, choosing and curating the training data well, and appropriately managing input and output sources—alongside their influence on the choice of AI models within the organization. This work makes two key contributions: It introduces the concept of sociotechnical envelopment by demonstrating the ways in which an organization’s successful AI envelopment depends on the interaction of social and technical factors, thus extending the literature’s focus beyond mere technical issues. Secondly, the empirical examples illustrate how operationalizing a sociotechnical envelopment enables an organization to manage the trade-off between low explainability and high performance presented by inscrutable models. These contributions pave the way for more responsible, accountable AI implementations in organizations, whereby humans can gain better control of even inscrutable machine-learning models."}, "authors": [{"id": "2461884", "name": "Aleksandre Asatiani"}, {"id": "40194127", "name": "P.

However, how efficiently the applied AI methods and algorithms have performed with respect to the type of applications and the multimodal sets of data domains have not yet been reviewed. Therefore, this paper aims to review and analyse the established AI methods in hospitality/tourism, ranging from data modelling for demand forecasting, tourism destination and behaviour pattern to enhanced customer service and experience.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe approach was to systematically review the relationship between AI methods and hospitality/tourism through a comprehensive literature review of papers published between 2010 and 2021. In total, 146 articles were identified and then critically analysed through content analysis into themes, including “AI methods” and “AI applications”.\n\n\nFindings\nThe review discovered new knowledge in identifying AI methods concerning the settings and available multimodal data sets in hospitality and tourism. Moreover, AI applications fostering the tourism/hospitality industries were identified. It also proposes novel personalised AI modelling development for smart tourism platforms to precisely predict tourism choice behaviour patterns.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThis review paper offers researchers and practitioners a broad understanding of the proper selection of AI methods that can potentially improve decision-making and decision-support in the tourism/hospitality industries.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis paper contributes to the tourism/hospitality literature with an interdisciplinary approach that reflects on theoretical/practical developments for data collection, data analysis and data modelling using AI-driven technology.\n"}, "authors": [{"id": "3466457", "name": "Z.

At the same time in emerging markets, the underbanked individuals cannot access traditional forms of collateral or identification that is required by financial institutions for them to be granted loans. Using the literature review approach through documentary and conceptual analysis to investigate the impact of machine learning and artificial intelligence in credit risk assessment, this study discovered that artificial intelligence and machine learning have a strong impact on credit risk assessments using alternative data sources such as public data to deal with the problems of information asymmetry, adverse selection, and moral hazard. This allows lenders to do serious credit risk analysis, to assess the behaviour of the customer, and subsequently to verify the ability of the clients to repay the loans, permitting less privileged people to access credit. Therefore, this study recommends that financial institutions such as banks and credit lending institutions invest more in artificial intelligence and machine learning to ensure that financially excluded households can obtain credit."}, "authors": [{"id": "1657730889", "name": "David Mhlanga"}], "fields_of_study": ["Business"]}

We provide a granular view of the complex interdependency patterns that connect developers, manufacturers, and users of AI. We distinguish between AI enablement, AI production, and AI consumption and analyze the emerging patterns of cospecialization between firms and communities. We find that AI provision is characterized by the dominance of a small number of Big Tech firms, whose downstream use of AI (e.g., search, payments, social media) has underpinned much of the recent progress in AI and who also provide the necessary upstream computing power provision (Cloud and Edge). These firms dominate top academic institutions in AI research, further strengthening their position. We find that AI is adopted by and benefits the small percentage of firms that can both digitize and access high-quality data. We consider how the AI sector has evolved differently in the three key geographies—China, the United States, and the European Union—and note that a handful of firms are building global AI ecosystems.

While there is an abundance of conceptual work on AI ethics, empirical insights are rare and often anecdotal. This paper fills the gap in our current understanding of how organisations deal with AI ethics by presenting empirical findings collected using a set of ten case studies and providing an account of the cross-case analysis. The paper reviews the discussion of ethical issues of AI as well as mitigation strategies that have been proposed in the literature. Using this background, the cross-case analysis categorises the organisational responses that were observed in practice. The discussion shows that organisations are highly aware of the AI ethics debate and keen to engage with ethical issues proactively. However, they make use of only a relatively small subsection of the mitigation strategies proposed in the literature. These insights are of importance to organisations deploying or using AI, to the academic AI ethics debate, but maybe most valuable to policymakers involved in the current debate about suitable policy developments to address the ethical issues raised by AI."}, "authors": [{"id": "1792014", "name": "B.

This paper aims to investigate VA-enabled interactions between hotels and guests in the hospitality context. The research positions VAs within the artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) context, disrupting old practices and processes. Smart hospitality uses VAs to support effortless value cocreation for guests cost-effectively. The research examines consumer perceptions and expectations of hospitality VAs and explores VA capabilities through expert technology providers.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis empirical paper investigates the current use and future implications of VAs for hotel environments. It uses qualitative, semi-structured in-depth interviews with 7 expert hospitality VA technology providers and 21 hotel guests who have VA experience. The research adopts a demand and supply approach, addressing the VAs in hospitality holistically.\n\n\nFindings\nThe findings illustrate the requirements from both end-users’ sides, hotels and guests, exploring VA advantages and challenges. The analysis demonstrates that VAs increasingly become digital assistants. VA technology helps hotels to improve customer service, expand operational capability and reduce costs. Although in its infancy, VA technology has made progress towards optimising hotel operations and upgrading customer service. The study proposes a speech-enabled interactions model.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThis research stimulates the transformation of hospitality services by using VAs and the development of smart hospitality and tourism ecosystems. The study can benefit from further research with hotel managers, to reflect hoteliers’ points of view and investigate their perception of VAs. Further research can also explore different aspects of consumer–VA interaction in different contexts.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThe paper makes a significant contribution to hospitality management and human–computer interaction best practices. It supports technology providers to reconsider how to develop suitable technology solutions towards improving their strategic competitiveness. It also explains how to use VAs cost-effectively and profitably while adding value to travellers’ experience.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nVA studies are often focussed on the technology in private households, rather than in commercial or hotel spaces. This paper contributes to the emerging literature on AI and IoT in smart hospitality and explores the acceptance and operationalisation of VAs. The research contributes to the conceptualisation of VA-enabled hotel services and explores positive and negative features, as well as future prospects.\n"}, "authors": [{"id": "2046748392", "name": "Dimitrios Buhalis"}, {"id": "2046747547", "name": "Iuliia Moldavska"}], "fields_of_study": null}

In an AI-based system, the data collection and pre-processing phase are vulnerable to sensor spoofing attacks and scaling attacks, respectively, while the training and inference phases of the model are subject to poisoning attacks and adversarial attacks, respectively. To address these severe security threats against the AI-based systems, in this article, we review the challenges and recent research advances for security issues in AI, so as to depict an overall blueprint for AI security.

Therefore, modelling and predicting water quality to control water pollution has been widely researched. The novelty of the proposed system is presented to develop an efficient operation of monitoring drinking water to ensure a sustainable and friendly green environment. In this work, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) algorithm was developed to predict the water quality index (WQI). Feed-forward neural network (FFNN) and K-nearest neighbors were applied to classify water quality. The dataset has eight significant parameters, but seven parameters were considered to show significant values. The proposed methodology was developed based on these statistical parameters. Prediction results demonstrated that the ANFIS model was superior for the prediction of WQI values. Nevertheless, the FFNN algorithm achieved the highest accuracy (100%) for water quality classification (WQC). Furthermore, the ANFIS model accurately predicted WQI, and the FFNN model showed superior robustness in classifying the WQC. In addition, the ANFIS model showed accuracy during the testing phase, with a regression coefficient of 96.17% for predicting WQI, and the FFNN model achieved the highest accuracy (100%) for WQC.

AI, which was first introduced in the 1950s, is defined as “the machine simulation of human mental reasoning, decision making, and behavior”. The increased power of computing, expansion of storage capacity, and compilation of medical big data helped the AI implementation surge in medical practice and research. Ophthalmology is a leading medical specialty in applying AI in screening, diagnosis, and treatment. The first Food and Drug Administration approved autonomous diagnostic system served to diagnose and classify diabetic retinopathy. Other ophthalmic conditions such as age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, retinopathy of prematurity, and congenital cataract, among others, implemented AI too. Purpose: To review the contemporary literature of the bioethical issues of AI in medicine and ophthalmology, classify ethical issues in medical AI, and suggest possible standardizations of ethical frameworks for AI implementation. Methods: Keywords were searched on Google Scholar and PubMed between October 2019 and April 2020. The results were reviewed, cross-referenced, and summarized. A total of 284 references including articles, books, book chapters, and regulatory reports and statements were reviewed, and those that were relevant were cited in the paper. Results: Most sources that studied the use of AI in medicine explored the ethical aspects. Bioethical challenges of AI implementation in medicine were categorized into 6 main categories. These include machine training ethics, machine accuracy ethics, patient-related ethics, physician-related ethics, shared ethics, and roles of regulators. Conclusions: There are multiple stakeholders in the ethical issues surrounding AI in medicine and ophthalmology. Attention to the various aspects of ethics related to AI is important especially with the expanding use of AI. Solutions of ethical problems are envisioned to be multifactorial."}, "authors": [{"id": "2140058636", "name": "Y. Abdullah"}, {"id": "2082486", "name": "J. Schuman"}, {"id": "4972632", "name": "R.

However, the perceptions and needs of such systems remain elusive, hindering efforts to promote AI adoption in health care. Objective This study aims to provide an overview of the perceptions and needs of AI to increase its adoption in health care. Methods A systematic scoping review was conducted according to the 5-stage framework by Arksey and O’Malley. Articles that described the perceptions and needs of AI in health care were searched across nine databases: ACM Library, CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, IEEE Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies that were published from inception until June 21, 2021. Articles that were not specific to AI, not research studies, and not written in English were omitted. Results Of the 3666 articles retrieved, 26 (0.71%) were eligible and included in this review. The mean age of the participants ranged from 30 to 72.6 years, the proportion of men ranged from 0% to 73.4%, and the sample sizes for primary studies ranged from 11 to 2780. The perceptions and needs of various populations in the use of AI were identified for general, primary, and community health care; chronic diseases self-management and self-diagnosis; mental health; and diagnostic procedures. The use of AI was perceived to be positive because of its availability, ease of use, and potential to improve efficiency and reduce the cost of health care service delivery. However, concerns were raised regarding the lack of trust in data privacy, patient safety, technological maturity, and the possibility of full automation. Suggestions for improving the adoption of AI in health care were highlighted: enhancing personalization and customizability; enhancing empathy and personification of AI-enabled chatbots and avatars; enhancing user experience, design, and interconnectedness with other devices; and educating the public on AI capabilities. Several corresponding mitigation strategies were also identified in this study. Conclusions The perceptions and needs of AI in its use in health care are crucial in improving its adoption by various stakeholders. Future studies and implementations should consider the points highlighted in this study to enhance the acceptability and adoption of AI in health care. This would facilitate an increase in the effectiveness and efficiency of health care service delivery to improve patient outcomes and satisfaction."}, "authors": [{"id": "35411879", "name": "H. S. J.

As pathogens evolve tactics for evading antibiotics, therapies decline in efficacy and must be replaced, distinguishing antibiotics from most other forms of drug development. Together with a slow and expensive antibiotic development pipeline, the proliferation of drug-resistant pathogens drives urgent interest in computational methods that promise to expedite candidate discovery. Strides in artificial intelligence (AI) have encouraged its application to multiple dimensions of computer-aided drug design, with increasing application to antibiotic discovery. This review describes AI-facilitated advances in the discovery of both small molecule antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides. Beyond the essential prediction of antimicrobial activity, emphasis is also given to antimicrobial compound representation, determination of drug-likeness traits, antimicrobial resistance, and de novo molecular design. Given the urgency of the antimicrobial resistance crisis, we analyze uptake of open science best practices in AI-driven antibiotic discovery and argue for openness and reproducibility as a means of accelerating preclinical research. Finally, trends in the literature and areas for future inquiry are discussed, as artificially intelligent enhancements to drug discovery at large offer many opportunities for future applications in antibiotic development. Melo, Maasch and de la Fuente-Nunez review the current practices in use of artificial intelligence in the discovery of antibiotics and antimicrobials. They also provide details about the best-practices that should be engaged with during computational drug discovery, including open science and reproducibility."}, "authors": [{"id": "50440020", "name": "Marcelo C.

To tackle these current difficulties, this article proposes secure AIoT for implicit group recommendations (SAIoT-GRs).

This study reviewed the applicability of AI for dental radiography from the current studies. Online searches on PubMed and IEEE Xplore databases, up to December 2020, and subsequent manual searches were performed. Then, we categorized the application of AI according to similarity of the following purposes: diagnosis of dental caries, periapical pathologies, and periodontal bone loss; cyst and tumor classification; cephalometric analysis; screening of osteoporosis; tooth recognition and forensic odontology; dental implant system recognition; and image quality enhancement. Current development of AI methodology in each aforementioned application were subsequently discussed. Although most of the reviewed studies demonstrated a great potential of AI application for dental radiography, further development is still needed before implementation in clinical routine due to several challenges and limitations, such as lack of datasets size justification and unstandardized reporting format.

In this study, we investigate how ethical principles (explainability, fairness, security, accountability, accuracy, privacy, and machine autonomy) are weighted in comparison to each other. This is especially important, since simultaneously considering ethical principles is not only costly, but sometimes even impossible, as developers must make specific trade-off decisions. In this paper, we give first answers on the relative importance of ethical principles given a specific use case—the use of artificial intelligence in tax fraud detection. The results of a large conjoint survey ( n = 1099 ) suggest that, by and large, German respondents evaluate the ethical principles as equally important. However, subsequent cluster analysis shows that different preference models for ethically designed systems exist among the German population. These clusters substantially differ not only in the preferred ethical principles but also in the importance levels of the principles themselves.

This study systematically reviews the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in COVID-19, especially for diagnosis, estimation of epidemic trends, prognosis, and exploration of effective and safe drugs and vaccines; and discusses the potential limitations. Methods: We report this systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library from inception to 19 September 2020 for published studies of AI applications in COVID-19. We used PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool) to assess the quality of literature related to the diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19. We registered the protocol (PROSPERO CRD42020211555). Results: We included 78 studies: 46 articles discussed AI-assisted diagnosis for COVID-19 with total accuracy of 70.00 to 99.92%, sensitivity of 73.00 to 100.00%, specificity of 25 to 100.00%, and area under the curve of 0.732 to 1.000. Fourteen articles evaluated prognosis based on clinical characteristics at hospital admission, such as clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics, reaching accuracy of 74.4 to 95.20%, sensitivity of 72.8 to 98.00%, specificity of 55 to 96.87% and AUC of 0.66 to 0.997 in predicting critical COVID-19. Nine articles used AI models to predict the epidemic of the COVID-19, such as epidemic peak, infection rate, number of infected cases, transmission laws, and development trend. Eight articles used AI to explore potential effective drugs, primarily through drug repurposing and drug development. Finally, 1 article predicted vaccine targets that have the potential to develop COVID-19 vaccines. Conclusions: In this review, we have shown that AI achieved high performance in diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, epidemic prediction and drug discovery for COVID-19.

Through an overview of current trends, we show that many explanations are generated post-hoc and independent of the agent's logical process, which in turn creates explanations with limited meaning as they lack transparency and fidelity. While user studies are a known basis for evaluating XAI, studies that do not consider objective metrics for evaluating XAI may have limited meaning and may suffer from confirmation bias, particularly if they use low fidelity explanations unnecessarily. To avoid this issue, this paper suggests a paradigm shift in evaluating XAI that focuses on metrics that quantify the explanation itself and its appropriateness given the XAI goal. We suggest four such metrics based on performance differences, D, between the explanation's logic and the agent's actual performance, the number of rules, R, outputted by the explanation, the number of features, F, used to generate that explanation, and the stability, S, of the explanation.

The recent development of laboratory nanoscale CT (nano-CT) systems has pushed the spatial resolution for battery material imaging to voxel sizes of 50 nm, a limit previously achievable only with synchrotron facilities. Given the non-destructive nature of CT, in situ and operando studies have emerged as powerful methods to quantify morphological parameters, such as tortuosity factor, porosity, surface area and volume expansion, during battery operation or cycling. Combined with artificial intelligence and machine learning analysis techniques, nano-CT has enabled the development of predictive models to analyse the impact of the electrode microstructure on cell performances or the influence of material heterogeneities on electrochemical responses. In this Review, we discuss the role of X-ray CT and nano-CT experimentation in the battery field, discuss the incorporation of artificial intelligence and machine learning analyses and provide a perspective on how the combination of multiscale CT imaging techniques can expand the development of predictive multiscale battery behavioural models. This Review discusses how artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms can be used in combination with X-ray computed tomography to study the composition and the dynamics of microstructures in battery materials with nanoscale resolution."}, "authors": [{"id": "20344414", "name": "J.

Thus, systems enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) are promising and time-saving solutions that may increase the quality of care. Objective This study aims to understand GPs’ attitudes toward AI-enabled systems in medical diagnosis. Methods We interviewed 18 GPs from Germany between March 2020 and May 2020 to identify determinants of GPs’ attitudes toward AI-based systems in diagnosis. By analyzing the interview transcripts, we identified 307 open codes, which we then further structured to derive relevant attitude determinants. Results We merged the open codes into 21 concepts and finally into five categories: concerns, expectations, environmental influences, individual characteristics, and minimum requirements of AI-enabled systems. Concerns included all doubts and fears of the participants regarding AI-enabled systems. Expectations reflected GPs’ thoughts and beliefs about expected benefits and limitations of AI-enabled systems in terms of GP care. Environmental influences included influences resulting from an evolving working environment, key stakeholders’ perspectives and opinions, the available information technology hardware and software resources, and the media environment. Individual characteristics were determinants that describe a physician as a person, including character traits, demographic characteristics, and knowledge. In addition, the interviews also revealed the minimum requirements of AI-enabled systems, which were preconditions that must be met for GPs to contemplate using AI-enabled systems. Moreover, we identified relationships among these categories, which we conflate in our proposed model. Conclusions This study provides a thorough understanding of the perspective of future users of AI-enabled systems in primary care and lays the foundation for successful market penetration. We contribute to the research stream of analyzing and designing AI-enabled systems and the literature on attitudes toward technology and practice by fostering the understanding of GPs and their attitudes toward such systems. Our findings provide relevant information to technology developers, policymakers, and stakeholder institutions of GP care."}, "authors": [{"id": "2015291770", "name": "Christoph Buck"}, {"id": "133886206", "name": "Eileen Doctor"}, {"id": "2151260638", "name": "Jasmin Hennrich"}, {"id": "9514249", "name": "Jan Jöhnk"}, {"id": "2151261309", "name": "Torsten Eymann"}], "fields_of_study": ["Medicine"]}

Using three types of explainable methods applied to the same medical image data set, we aimed to improve the comprehensibility of the decisions provided by the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In vivo gastral images obtained by a video capsule endoscopy (VCE) were the subject of visual explanations, with the goal of increasing health professionals’ trust in black-box predictions. We implemented two post hoc interpretable machine learning methods, called Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and an alternative explanation approach, the Contextual Importance and Utility (CIU) method. The produced explanations were assessed by human evaluation. We conducted three user studies based on explanations provided by LIME, SHAP and CIU. Users from different non-medical backgrounds carried out a series of tests in a web-based survey setting and stated their experience and understanding of the given explanations. Three user groups (n = 20, 20, 20) with three distinct forms of explanations were quantitatively analyzed. We found that, as hypothesized, the CIU-explainable method performed better than both LIME and SHAP methods in terms of improving support for human decision-making and being more transparent and thus understandable to users. Additionally, CIU outperformed LIME and SHAP by generating explanations more rapidly. Our findings suggest that there are notable differences in human decision-making between various explanation support settings. In line with that, we present three potential explainable methods that, with future improvements in implementation, can be generalized to different medical data sets and can provide effective decision support to medical experts."}, "authors": [{"id": "116188635", "name": "Samanta Knapic"}, {"id": "2718975", "name": "A.

Technology providers as well as marketers increasingly work to leverage the use of voice assistants to engage their customers and offer them more personalized value propositions. This article examines the various consumption values associated with the use of voice assistants. Based on a theoretical framework rooted in the “theory of consumption values” (TCV), we undertake a mixed-methods approach that comprises interviews with experts (n = 5) and consumers (n = 30) as well as a cross-sectional survey with active users of voice assistants (n = 371). The article considers five consumption values—social identity, convenience, personification, perceived usefulness, and perceived playfulness—and two types of usage of voice assistants—information search and task function. Our findings contextualize and extend the TCV framework using voice assistant technology and obtain empirical support for the interrelation of consumption values. We find that social identity and personification have a strong positive association with both usefulness and playfulness. Furthermore, usefulness and playfulness are positively associated with information search and task function. In addition, trust and frequency of use significantly (and positively) moderate the association between usefulness and usage of voice assistants. Technology providers and marketers can capitalize on these findings to develop various voice-enabled applications and services that enhance the consumer experience and consumer engagement."}, "authors": [{"id": "82961640", "name": "Suresh Malodia"}, {"id": "2053427104", "name": "N.

Despite their tremendous success, many such techniques suffer from the “black-box” problem, which refers to situations where the data analyst is unable to explain why such techniques arrive at certain decisions. This problem has fuelled interest in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which refers to techniques that can easily be interpreted by humans. Unfortunately, many of these techniques are not suitable for tabular data, which is surprising given the importance and widespread use of tabular data in critical applications such as finance, healthcare, and criminal justice. Also surprising is the fact that, despite the vast literature on XAI, there are still no survey articles to date that focus on tabular data. Consequently, despite the existing survey articles that cover a wide range of XAI techniques, it remains challenging for researchers working on tabular data to go through all of these surveys and extract the techniques that are suitable for their analysis. Our article fills this gap by providing a comprehensive and up-to-date survey of the XAI techniques that are relevant to tabular data. Furthermore, we categorize the references covered in our survey, indicating the type of the model being explained, the approach being used to provide the explanation, and the XAI problem being addressed.

Medical students need to be sufficiently proficient in AI, its advantages to improve healthcare's expenses, quality, and access. Similarly, students must be educated about the shortfalls of AI such as bias, transparency, and liability. Overlooking a technology that will be transformative for the foreseeable future would place medical students at a disadvantage. However, there has been little interest in researching a proper method to implement AI in the medical education curriculum. This study aims to review the current literature that covers the attitudes of medical students towards AI, implementation of AI in the medical curriculum, and describe the need for more research in this area. METHODS An integrative review was performed to combine data from various research designs and literature. Pubmed, Medline (Ovid), GoogleScholar, and Web of Science articles between 2010 and 2020 were all searched with particular inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full text of the selected articles was analyzed using the Extension of Technology Acceptance Model and the Diffusions of Innovations theory. Data were successively pooled together, recorded, and analyzed quantitatively using a modified Hawkings evaluation form. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses was utilized to help improve reporting. RESULTS A total of 39 articles meeting inclusion criteria were identified. Primary assessments of medical students attitudes were identified (n = 5). Plans to implement AI in the curriculum for the purpose of teaching students about AI (n = 6) and articles reporting actual implemented changes (n = 2) were assessed. Finally, 26 articles described the need for more research on this topic or calling for the need of change in medical curriculum to anticipate AI in healthcare.

Despite the enthusiasm, health care professionals still struggle to implement AI in their daily practice. Objective This paper aims to identify the implementation frameworks used to understand the application of AI in health care practice. Methods A scoping review was conducted using the Cochrane, Evidence Based Medicine Reviews, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO databases to identify publications that reported frameworks, models, and theories concerning AI implementation in health care. This review focused on studies published in English and investigating AI implementation in health care since 2000. A total of 2541 unique publications were retrieved from the databases and screened on titles and abstracts by 2 independent reviewers. Selected articles were thematically analyzed against the Nilsen taxonomy of implementation frameworks, and the Greenhalgh framework for the nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability (NASSS) of health care technologies. Results In total, 7 articles met all eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review, and 2 articles included formal frameworks that directly addressed AI implementation, whereas the other articles provided limited descriptions of elements influencing implementation. Collectively, the 7 articles identified elements that aligned with all the NASSS domains, but no single article comprehensively considered the factors known to influence technology implementation. New domains were identified, including dependency on data input and existing processes, shared decision-making, the role of human oversight, and ethics of population impact and inequality, suggesting that existing frameworks do not fully consider the unique needs of AI implementation. Conclusions This literature review demonstrates that understanding how to implement AI in health care practice is still in its early stages of development. Our findings suggest that further research is needed to provide the knowledge necessary to develop implementation frameworks to guide the future implementation of AI in clinical practice and highlight the opportunity to draw on existing knowledge from the field of implementation science."}, "authors": [{"id": "2151267822", "name": "Fábio Gama"}, {"id": "115301083", "name": "Daniel Tyskbo"}, {"id": "49900973", "name": "J.

However, their non-linear, complex structures are often difficult to interpret. Consequently, many scholars have developed a plethora of methods to explain their functioning and the logic of their inferences. This systematic review aimed to organise these methods into a hierarchical classification system that builds upon and extends existing taxonomies by adding a significant dimension—the output formats. The reviewed scientific papers were retrieved by conducting an initial search on Google Scholar with the keywords “explainable artificial intelligence”; “explainable machine learning”; and “interpretable machine learning”. A subsequent iterative search was carried out by checking the bibliography of these articles. The addition of the dimension of the explanation format makes the proposed classification system a practical tool for scholars, supporting them to select the most suitable type of explanation format for the problem at hand. Given the wide variety of challenges faced by researchers, the existing XAI methods provide several solutions to meet the requirements that differ considerably between the users, problems and application fields of artificial intelligence (AI). The task of identifying the most appropriate explanation can be daunting, thus the need for a classification system that helps with the selection of methods. This work concludes by critically identifying the limitations of the formats of explanations and by providing recommendations and possible future research directions on how to build a more generally applicable XAI method. Future work should be flexible enough to meet the many requirements posed by the widespread use of AI in several fields, and the new regulations."}, "authors": [{"id": "14599798", "name": "Giulia Vilone"}, {"id": "35186448", "name": "Longo Luca"}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science"]}

Several machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have been developed for systematic identification of drug repurposing leads based on big data resources, hence further accelerating and de-risking the drug development process by computational means. Areas covered: The authors focus on supervised ML and AI methods that make use of publicly available databases and information resources. While most of the example applications are in the field of anticancer drug therapies, the methods and resources reviewed are widely applicable also to other indications including COVID-19 treatment. A particular emphasis is placed on the use of comprehensive target activity profiles that enable a systematic repurposing process by extending the target profile of drugs to include potent off-targets with therapeutic potential for a new indication. Expert opinion: The scarcity of clinical patient data and the current focus on genetic aberrations as primary drug targets may limit the performance of anticancer drug repurposing approaches that rely solely on genomics-based information. Functional testing of cancer patient cells exposed to a large number of targeted therapies and their combinations provides an additional source of repurposing information for tissue-aware AI approaches."}, "authors": [{"id": "51409579", "name": "Ziaurrehman Tanoli"}, {"id": "1397981788", "name": "M.

Further, a model, artificial intelligence acceptance and digital entrepreneurship (AIADE) is theorized after formulating some hypotheses. The theorized model has been validated with 476 useable responses.FindingsThe findings revealed that performance expectancy, openness, social influence, hedonic motivations and generativity have a positive impact on entrepreneur's acceptance intention of AI. Additionally, affordance has no direct relationship with AI acceptance intention, but it affects AI acceptance intention through attitude. Inconvenience has a significant negative relationship with the intention to accept AI, while uncertainty was found to be positively affecting the AI acceptance intention. Effort expectancy did not confirm any significant relationship.Research limitations/implicationsBy considering existing theoretical models and concepts the authors contribute to the AI's theoretical progress, specifically in the domain of entrepreneurship. The authors complement and extend existing technology adoption/acceptance theories and digital entrepreneurship theories by developing a theoretical model, AIADE, explaining the entrepreneur's intention to accept AI.Practical implicationsThe practical implications of the study show that performance expectancy (positive), openness (positive), social influence (positive), hedonic motivations (positive), generativity (positive), affordance through attitude (positive), uncertainty (positive), effort expectancy (negative) and inconvenience (negative) are the antecedents for the entrepreneurs to accept AI for digital entrepreneurship. The authors suggest that intentional improvement planning is developed by increasing entrepreneur's positive perceptions of AI affordance and explanation of its generativity and openness, and improving their attitude of using AI for digital entrepreneurship.Originality/valueThis is the first study that reveals the critical antecedents of entrepreneur's intention to accept AI for digital entrepreneurship.

However, the notion of the rule of law defies the phenomenon of law being bound to national borders and enjoys global recognition. However, a serious threat to the rule of law is looming in the form of an assault by technological developments within artificial intelligence (AI). As large strides are made in the academic discipline of AI, this technology is starting to make its way into digital decision-making systems and is in effect replacing human decision-makers. A prime example of this development is the use of AI to assist judges in making judicial decisions. However, in many circumstances this technology is a ‘black box’ due mainly to its complexity but also because it is protected by law. This lack of transparency and the diminished ability to understand the operation of these systems increasingly being used by the structures of governance is challenging traditional notions underpinning the rule of law. This is especially so in relation to concepts especially associated with the rule of law, such as transparency, fairness and explainability. This article examines the technology of AI in relation to the rule of law, highlighting the rule of law as a mechanism for human flourishing. It investigates the extent to which the rule of law is being diminished as AI is becoming entrenched within society and questions the extent to which it can survive in the technocratic society."}, "authors": [{"id": "40129416", "name": "S.

Real-world examples of organizations who are using AI in digital marketing abound. For example, Red Balloon and Harley Davidson used AI to automate their digital advertising campaigns. However, we are early in the process of both the practical application of AI by firms broadly and by their marketing functions in particular. One could argue that we are even earlier in the research process of conceptualizing, theorizing, and researching the use and impact of AI. Importantly, as with most technologies of significant potential, the application of AI in marketing engenders not just practical considerations but ethical questions as well. The ability of AI to automate activities, that in the past people did, also raises the issue of whether marketing professionals will embrace AI as a means to free them from more mundane tasks to spend time on higher value activities, or will they view AI as a threat to their employment? Given the nascent nature of research on AI at this point, the full capabilities and limitations of AI in marketing are unknown.

Such systems boost the problem not only by increasing opportunities to create realistic AI-generated fake content, but also, and essentially, by facilitating the dissemination of disinformation to a targeted audience and at scale by malicious stakeholders. This situation entails multiple ethical and human rights concerns, in particular regarding human dignity, autonomy, democracy, and peace. In reaction, other AI systems are developed to detect and moderate disinformation online. Such systems do not escape from ethical and human rights concerns either, especially regarding freedom of expression and information. Having originally started with ascending co-regulation, the European Union (EU) is now heading toward descending co-regulation of the phenomenon. In particular, the Digital Services Act proposal provides for transparency obligations and external audit for very large online platforms’ recommender systems and content moderation. While with this proposal, the Commission focusses on the regulation of content considered as problematic, the EU Parliament and the EU Council call for enhancing access to trustworthy content. In light of our study, we stress that the disinformation problem is mainly caused by the business model of the web that is based on advertising revenues, and that adapting this model would reduce the problem considerably. We also observe that while AI systems are inappropriate to moderate disinformation content online, and even to detect such content, they may be more appropriate to counter the manipulation of the digital ecosystem."}, "authors": [{"id": "2141902334", "name": "Noémi Bontridder"}, {"id": "26580678", "name": "Y.

One of the main obstacles to the incorporation of automated AI-based decision-making tools in medicine is the failure of models to generalize when deployed across institutions with heterogeneous populations and imaging protocols. The most well-understood pitfall in developing these AI models is overfitting, which has, in part, been overcome by optimizing training protocols. However, overfitting is not the only obstacle to the success and generalizability of AI. Underspecification is also a serious impediment that requires conceptual understanding and correction. It is well known that a single AI pipeline, with prescribed training and testing sets, can produce several models with various levels of generalizability. Underspecification defines the inability of the pipeline to identify whether these models have embedded the structure of the underlying system by using a test set independent of, but distributed identically, to the training set. An underspecified pipeline is unable to assess the degree to which the models will be generalizable. Stress testing is a known tool in AI that can limit underspecification and, importantly, assure broad generalizability of AI models. However, the application of stress tests is new in radiologic applications. This report describes the concept of underspecification from a radiologist perspective, discusses stress testing as a specific strategy to overcome underspecification, and explains how stress tests could be designed in radiology-by modifying medical images or stratifying testing datasets. In the upcoming years, stress tests should become in radiology the standard that crash tests have become in the automotive industry.

We discuss the current AI technologies, including mobile phone applications, reminder systems, tools for patient empowerment, instruments that can be used in integrated care, and machine learning. The use of AI may be key to understanding the complex interplay of factors that underly medication non-adherence in NCD patients. AI-assisted interventions aiming to improve communication between patients and physicians, monitor drug consumption, empower patients, and ultimately, increase adherence levels may lead to better clinical outcomes and increase the quality of life of NCD patients. However, the use of AI in healthcare is challenged by numerous factors; the characteristics of users can impact the effectiveness of an AI tool, which may lead to further inequalities in healthcare, and there may be concerns that it could depersonalize medicine. The success and widespread use of AI technologies will depend on data storage capacity, processing power, and other infrastructure capacities within healthcare systems.

This is driven by the easier access to sensory data and the enormous scale of pervasive/ubiquitous devices that generate zettabytes of real-time data streams. Designing accurate models using such data streams, to revolutionize the decision-taking process, inaugurates pervasive computing as a worthy paradigm for a better quality-of-life (e.g., smart homes and self-driving cars.). The confluence of pervasive computing and artificial intelligence, namely Pervasive AI, expanded the role of ubiquitous IoT systems from mainly data collection to executing distributed computations with a promising alternative to centralized learning, presenting various challenges, including privacy and latency requirements. In this context, an intelligent resource scheduling should be envisaged among IoT devices (e.g., smartphones, smart vehicles) and infrastructure (e.g., edge nodes and base stations) to avoid communication and computation overheads and ensure maximum performance. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the recent techniques and strategies developed to overcome these resource challenges in pervasive AI systems. Specifically, we first present an overview of pervasive computing, its architecture, and its intersection with artificial intelligence. We then review the background, applications and performance metrics of AI, particularly Deep Learning (DL) and reinforcement learning, running in a ubiquitous system. Next, we provide a deep literature review of communication-efficient techniques, from both algorithmic and system perspectives, of distributed training and inference across the combination of IoT devices, edge devices and cloud servers.

Findings In this diagnostic study of 20 primary care physicians and 20 nurse practitioners reviewing 1048 retrospective cases, artificial intelligence assistance was significantly associated with higher agreement with diagnoses made by a dermatologist panel, with an increase from 48% to 58% for primary care physicians and an increase from 46% to 58% for nurse practitioners. These outcomes correspond to a benefit for 1 in every 8 to 10 cases. Meaning Artificial intelligence may help clinicians diagnose skin conditions more accurately in primary care practices, where most skin diseases are initially evaluated."}, "authors": [{"id": "2636295", "name": "Ayush Jain"}, {"id": "1704215619", "name": "David H.

However, these AI Ethics Principles often fail to be actioned in governmental policy. This paper proposes a novel framework for the development of ‘Actionable Principles for AI’. The approach acknowledges the relevance of AI Ethics Principles and homes in on methodological elements to increase their practical implementability in policy processes. As a case study, elements are extracted from the development process of the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI of the European Commission’s “High Level Expert Group on AI”. Subsequently, these elements are expanded on and evaluated in light of their ability to contribute to a prototype framework for the development of 'Actionable Principles for AI'. The paper proposes the following three propositions for the formation of such a prototype framework: (1) preliminary landscape assessments; (2) multi-stakeholder participation and cross-sectoral feedback; and, (3) mechanisms to support implementation and operationalizability."}, "authors": [{"id": "1397118333", "name": "Charlotte Stix"}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"]}

The present study aimed to assess whether real-time artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted optical diagnosis is accurate enough to implement the leave-in-situ strategy for diminutive (≤ 5 mm) rectosigmoid polyps (DRSPs). Methods  Consecutive colonoscopy outpatients with ≥ 1 DRSP were included. DRSPs were categorized as adenomas or nonadenomas by the endoscopists, who had differing expertise in optical diagnosis, with the assistance of a real-time AI system (CAD-EYE). The primary end point was ≥ 90 % negative predictive value (NPV) for adenomatous histology in high confidence AI-assisted optical diagnosis of DRSPs (Preservation and Incorporation of Valuable endoscopic Innovations [PIVI-1] threshold), with histopathology as the reference standard. The agreement between optical- and histology-based post-polypectomy surveillance intervals (≥ 90 %; PIVI-2 threshold) was also calculated according to European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and United States Multi-Society Task Force (USMSTF) guidelines. Results  Overall 596 DRSPs were retrieved for histology in 389 patients; an AI-assisted high confidence optical diagnosis was made in 92.3 %. The NPV of AI-assisted optical diagnosis for DRSPs (PIVI-1) was 91.0 % (95 %CI 87.1 %–93.9 %). The PIVI-2 threshold was met with 97.4 % (95 %CI 95.7 %–98.9 %) and 92.6 % (95 %CI 90.0 %–95.2 %) of patients according to ESGE and USMSTF, respectively. AI-assisted optical diagnosis accuracy was significantly lower for nonexperts (82.3 %, 95 %CI 76.4 %–87.3 %) than for experts (91.9 %, 95 %CI 88.5 %–94.5 %); however, nonexperts quickly approached the performance levels of experts over time. Conclusion  AI-assisted optical diagnosis matches the required PIVI thresholds. This does not however offset the need for endoscopistsʼ high level confidence and expertise. The AI system seems to be useful, especially for nonexperts."}, "authors": [{"id": "8985548", "name": "E. Rondonotti"}, {"id": "2358832895", "name": "C. Hassan"}, {"id": "66197385", "name": "G.

Informatics degree programs are scrambling to meet the ever-increasing market demand of such professions. To explore the skillsets required for AI and ML positions, the authors conducted a content analysis of online job advertisements posted on Indeed.com. They present a ranking of the relevant skills for the two positions. Further, they performed a pairwise comparison between AI and ML positions. Overall, it was observed that technical skills like data mining, programming, statistics and big data are more valued for ML positions than for AI positions. On the contrary, AI positions tend to be more generic, with an emphasis on communication skills. These clearly defined skills can be valuable for the hiring process as well as to revamp existing course curricula to cater to the increasing market demand."}, "authors": [{"id": "2113856320", "name": "Amita Verma"}, {"id": "2873574", "name": "Kamal Lamsal"}, {"id": "2089712049", "name": "Payal Verma"}], "fields_of_study": ["Computer Science"]}
